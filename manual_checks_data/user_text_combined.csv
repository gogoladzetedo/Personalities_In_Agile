If the custom does not match any of those in then the channel configuration fails with The code needs to consult custom converters to see what (s) they support - and the output Java type. See. Rabbit Bus: Expose on. Related to XD-2567 which fixed this problem, but only in the bus. WARN - skipping header since it is not of expected type , it is. PubSub consumers can support concurrency since the threads are competing consumers on the queue.. For some reason, the Integration is not preventing the standard context from exporting the . This should be suppressed (when an IMBE is present) because it's annotated . Causes . Workaround in the stack overflow answer. Could be an SI issue, but investigation needed. However, we should probably include the stream job name in all MBeans for the stream (as is done for the integration exporter).. 2 Exchanges left behind..

This deprecated in SI Use in instead. Not that this can safely be done in - the preferred mechanism is available in SI too.. Expose Retryable Exceptions in the Retry Configuration. As a developer, I would like to be able to configure which exceptions thrown by a module should be retryable within the . As usual, these should be configurable at the bus and or stream deployment property level. Also consider disabling retry for kryo problems. We are running Spring XD with RabbitMQ transport and we'd like to have a way to stop retries in certain situations. In , in chapter about RabbitMQ transport, in ""A Note About Retry"" section, it's written: Message deliveries failing with a (perhaps when using a custom are never retried; the assumption being that if a message could not be converted on the first attempt, subsequent attempts will also fail. Following is unclear: Are we speaking about or ? Based on XD-1597 and AMQP-390 it's the latter. Only is available for custom module developers. Attempting to throw which is provided by results in even after Spring XD is configured to use transport. Throwing from custom processor module written with Spring Integration's or doesn't stop retries.. The uses the Integration Scheduler to run batch jobs Launching batch jobs with the uses the Integration default which only has 10 threads by default. Use the instead to free up the scheduler threads. However, we need to consider whether a separate configuration is needed to limit the number of batch jobs - it's possible the existing bus utor configuration is enough.. LocalMessageBus Will Only Run 10 Jobs by Default. This error surfaced recently as a result of a fix to a bug in which disabled this test in all environments. Now the test has been reactivated it is failing on the branch. The test runs OK on master.. This should probably be changed to: Documentation:. STS Gradle Import Missing Dependencies without Enabling Scala. Clear documentation of how to add needed dependencies for using in an XD stream.. Thanks to Gary I found this little gem of documentation to be able to use xpath expression in XD. Only hiccup is that I had to also add the to the classpath (otherwise it is missing XPathException class).. Add the Dependencies Required to Use xpath in Streams. Since the message-driven adapter uses a , the default behavior is to lose messages on exceptions (with the DMLC, the message is ack'd before the listener is invoked). In order to provide recovery of such situations, the source needs to expose so it can be set to . Or, perhaps, given that we don't expose complex configuration, the source should use a instead (where the ack is sent after the listener is successfully invoked).. Currently, you cannot suppress (or change) the prefix on user-defined headers. See Add $ property.. ""trackHistory"" is an optional attribute * -Tab on shell should list. See With set with back-whacks, it fails on with set with whacks, it fails with . The StackOverflow failure is similar. works fine.. An additional commit ( for XD-2230 was applied only to master; it needs to be backported to. I believe it is being cause by the following PR: XD-2381: Split MessageBus and Analytics dependencies from DIRT PR: 1307 SHA:. Here is the full exception: Dispatcher has no subscribers for channel nested exception is Dispatcher has no subscribers and here is that stream: filter router Gary Russell: This looks like another (not fixed by the previous fix) timing problem with taps when using singlenode. The tap is started before the tap stream is deployed. But it's not clear to me how the filter module could be deployed bound as a consumer before the Gary Russell: I see the problem: binds the consumer before the producer - this is the wrong order for a passive component such as the filter. cc. When establishing the tap, we create the tap channel and add the WireTap before the tap channel has been bound to the bus. ERROR - Dispatcher has no subscribers for channel nested exception is Dispatcher has no subscribers at. Upgrade to Spring SI SA. Add a Retry Dead Letter Interceptor to the RabbitMQ Source. Provide for retry and or dead-lettering for the rabbit source (similar to the rabbit message bus).. It is documented here But maybe it should also be at the top of the appendix?. The JMS Source Sink has a pluggable provider (default ) but the URL property implies activeMQ - the property name should be generic (found while testing XD-1149).. Add Support for addresses Property on RabbitMQ Source. Documentation for data partitioning, and all Rabbit Bus properties. Remove from tcp Source; Add Binary Support to the http Source. The TCP source converts to String. This prevents binary transfers. Remove the transformer; if the user wants a String; (s)he can use (assuming the byte stream has valid UTF-8 encoding). Another option would be to add a option, but since conversion can already handle it, it's probably better to use that. On the other hand, a option would enable backwards compatibility. The http source also converts to String.. Allows looking at message headers without turning on debugging.. XD-1019 added simple (stateless) retry to the message bus. Use stateful retry and an enabling failed messages to be requeued on the broker until successful (perhaps because another instance can handle the message); also provides a mechanism to route failed messages to a dead-letter exchange. Requires setting the message id header in bus-generated messages. Also add profiles and properties for common retry backoff policies.. If the rabbit source receives a message it can't convert, a is thrown and the message is rejected (and requeued), causing an endless loop. Add an to the inbound adapter to detect and convert to . Also consider adding a retry interceptor to do the same for exceptions in modules (when using local transport).. Update to Spring AMQP. tx-size, concurrency etc.. Update Spring-AMQP to to. For some reason, the partitioned batch jobs are storing s in the DB with a null ID. This causes to fail because the HATEOS code asserts not For some reason, the query for objects with the also returned these two objects with null keys. Blowing away my data directory fixes the problem (until I run another partitioned batch job). I need to figure out why spring batch is creating these bad records, but we should probably add some defensive code to protect against null IDs. You can reproduce by building against my XD-1146 branch.. Migrate to SI Redis Queue and Topic Adapters. When INT-3133 is resolved, SpEL s are inherited from parent contexts. Instead of adding the to each module's context, add it to the parent instead.. Move SpEL to Module Parent Context. Fix Javadoc and Compiler Warnings. and . references and is referenced by (and stopped).. Taps are currently source modules. They could be refactored to simply bridge the tapped module's tap pub sub topic directly (with conversion) to the first tap module's input channel. Note - ensure destroy works. Currently the tap is destroyed by the simple fact it is a module; if it's no longer a module we'll need special handling to stop remove the tap adapter.. Factor out common Redis Rabbit code. Also, factor out common inbound tap code (very similar). Change transport nternals to Use instead of and .. Revert XD-624 When SI is Available. When importing Spring-XD as a gradle project, in STS, while building the model, we get Root exception: Project location doesn't exist: . gradlew eclipse creates these directories, but the plugin needs them before running that task The problem seems to be that these ""projects"" are not really projects. Perhaps a quick fix would be to commit these directories (with a dummy file) ??. As a user, I'd like to have the option to delete the queues topics so that we can include an optional attribute as part of the stream destroy command to also clean-up the associated queues topics. Consider the possibility of producers and or queues still containing data Some Further Thoughts Consider using the upcoming Spring AMQP REST API if the timing is not right, we could temporarily invoke the rabbit REST API directly. Should this be done by the admin? Or, via a new plugin handling module undeployments - in the rabbit case, undeploying a consumer would check for us being the last consumer and remove the since we undeploy left- right, everything can be cleaned up on the consumer side. Down side of doing it on the admin is that he wouldn't necessarily know which rabbit cluster a stream was deployed to - so it probably has to happen on the container - even so, we'd need the admin url(s) for the cluster.. stats (Message send receive counts, avg ution time, queue stats, error rates, job stats, etc) Metrics exposed in JMX and JSON through Jolokia? Existing monitoring tool for visualization and reporting vs custom dashboard TODO what makes sense as auto-responses to control actions? Auto-scaling of XD nodes, more fine-grained message queue throttling, etc Expose metrics of interest to the internal workings of XD, particularly in transport mechanism Should be doable with external monitoring system Trace individual messages, average message throughput would be interesting to end users too if not too expensive to trace Don't want to get too far into replacing a profiler Way to hook into the module-grouped metric exports.

Parameter parsing does not work if an argument contains ' For example: Also, I was surprised that this but this I think we need to tokenize the argument (with ' if contains spaces) and remove any surrounding from the result.

Now that i think of it, adding a property on would probably better, but even better would not be introducing anything new like this at all. Having the new annotation on the method level means it applies to all command arguments, though i suppose this case will only involve commands that have one 'pass through' parameter. 2) it would be nicer to avoid calling the tokenizer at all if we know that the text should remain 'untouched'.

Create REST API for getting information on all job utions for a given name. Develop out a Proof of concept for review that allows users to easily create a new Java based module to Spring XD. An ideal flow would be 1. In the shell, have a command to create a new custom module - for example a stream processor. This would pick the appropriate starter pom to create an XD application. 2. Open up the project in an IDE. There should be a shell of code that has a Processor module and also something in the test directory the shell of some code for testing the module. 3. On the command line, issue a command equivalent to mvn that would build, test and create an packaged file (single) that can be dropped into a module registry directory The same general flow would apply for batch jobs. ATM XML centric stream defs batch job defs would be sufficient. Having the option for JavaConfig style batch job definitions would be nice as there isn't a DSL for batch jobs (and likely won't be except for a trivial case). One shouldn't have to restart the xd-container in order to use this new processor.. Change default container port from 9000 to something else. Add bridge module. Add support for Hortonworks Data Platform. This will allow for some easy demonstration of how 'HATEOS' works via links in our REST API. There are probably some quite useful commands here that could be used from the Spring Data REST shell longer term, but a good place to take a look at now. Goal is to show how metrics such as counters are accessible w o having to switch tabs to use wget. The pretty printing of the returned JSON is an important feature to help understand the response, this functionality can be taken from reused from the Spring Data REST shell. This relates to XD-871 which provides a good scenario. stream create s1 ""http log stream create s2 ""http log The second command results in an error message that the port is in use but the stream definition is still saved. Since create + deploy is a logical unit of work, it should follow transactional semantics. In other words if the deploy fails, the repository should be rolled back (or a compensating destroy should be performed). Note this should not be handled the same way if create and deploy happen separately. In that case, the stream definition should remain.. Use a modal dialog to specify runtime parameters. There should be a little text are that gives hints as to the spring batch parameter key value conventions, for type. Might be a good idea to have a checkbox that lets you select to 'auto increment' job instance number. 4 columns key, value, type, identifying and an 'add parameter' button that adds a new row. This would appear as a modal dialog box, polling of the state of the deployments would be suspended while the job parameter modal dialog box is shown.. DataSource for batch infrastructure should be configurable, not hardcoded to hsqldb. Don't perform error-level logging for normal application behavior in batch admin functionality. UI: User should be able to filter the list of utions on the ution tab. On clicking a specific job name in the deployed jobs list, we need to redirect the user to show the list of all the job utions on that job. User should be able to navigate back to the deployed jobs list.. The HDFS Sink should support writing POJOs to HDFS using Avro Kite SDK with support for partitioning. Writing POJOs using Kite SDK.

This is issue depends on XD-761. We should depend on $ $ we are using spring batch We need to depend on version. Spring Batch Admin provides a complete, but outdated implementation style, which covers the full administrative lifecycle of batch jobs, their creation, stop start, and retrieving information about previous job utions and the status of currently uting job utions. SpringXD has a different way of deploying, starting, and stopping jobs - by sending messages to containers that run the batch job. However, the reporting state of a job is still stored in a common job repository. The purpose of this story is to take the first step to merging in the existing code base that focuses only on the retrieval of information from Spring Batch Admins Job controller. The current REST API style of these commands should stay as close to the original spring batch admin style as possible. There are several reasons for this 1. It works, and time to springone is short, and we mgmt has expectations around deliverables that we must strive to meet. 2. It gives Andrew a working contract to start developing a UI 3. We can take on this technical debt, but refactor after RC1 and before GA while and deliver end-user functionality. Attached is the list of endpoints in spring batch admin.

Writing POJOs using CDK Data (Avro) We should support both partitioned and This story addresses only Document limitations in terms of which Java types are supported and not supported by the Avro serialization. note, the LZO codes are GPL-licensed, so can't be included in the distribution. It is splittable, which makes it a good candidate for writing without any additional data file container structure such as sequence or avro files.. Support writing to HDFS text file using the LZO codec. Support writing to HDFS text file using the BZip2Codec. Investigate throughput performance writing to HDFS. This could be an optimization, to be verified, that delegating the writing operations to Reactor with a backing ringbuffer will increase the throughput performance. Other strategies, such as threads to handle writes to individual files concurrently, should be investigated.. h2. Narrative As XD, I need a persistent way to register job definitions (beyond the map registry implementation provided by Spring Batch). h2. Acceptance Criteria XD should be able to register, unregister, and find job definitions via the registry. The registry should be backed by Redis so that it is persistent.. Create JobDefinition repository. Retrieve description of all registered modules. Add command for deleting a stream. Add command for listing streams. Type conversion and co-location of modules. When a module is deployed, it should run in its own isolated classpath. The current code has all dependencies in a single classpath, taken from the lib directory at startup. This has a number of drawbacks, one of the most important is the batch jobs can not be contributed to the system at runtime. The work for this epic is decoupled from any module deployment story. The assumption is that there will be a directory layout as shown below. Current layout And inside source Using an example of the source directory from the current the new layout would be We should support both the new and old layout styles There what is under 'file' directory is the 'package' No .zip, war, is required.. Deploying Custom Code. Modules (sinks, processors, sources) should be able to be easily tested inside the IDE using JUnit. Support various output format, Avro, SequenceFile, more advanced rollover options.. Add Twitter gardenhose source module. Add RabbitMQ source module. Add support to load a file in the source. Documentation for developing streams in the IDE needs to mention including scripts dir to project classpath. can make use of the system property inside an import statement. This determines which version of the XD infrastructure to load, for example what implementation, Local or Redis based, or specific message listener containers. File name conventions should be used, so if the option passed in from the command line is localChannel then the XML filename looked for has the 'Protocol' suffix applied, and is loaded via the classpath. Redis and Local will not be the only options, other will be provided in the future, Rabbit, and the user may be able to provide their own of these infrastructure classes (an advanced task).. Document how to create a custom input output module for existing SI channel adapters. Add more structure, more easily find the reference guide. The style that is here is nice..

The gradle application task should get us most of the way to create a distributable artifact akin to what you see when downloading tomcat jetty etc. Now there is a launch task task(launch, dependsOn: 'classes', type: JavaExec) The same main should be referenced in the application plugin, a task to create a .zip distributable is needed. Ideally would be nice to 1. download .zip 2. unzip 3. cd spring-xd bin 4. xdserver start and gracefully shutdown later with 5. xdserver stop I don't know if we can should bundle redis, I think we should bundle it.

4,xd,david_geary,"All modules that allow groovy (filter, script, transform, router, tcpclient) allow automatic refresh of the script when it changes. In the XD documentation it is stated that this refresh occurs every minute eg for filter at ""The script is checked for updates every 60 seconds, so it may be replaced in a running system. "" This set up can be seen in the spring xml for the modules - eg (again for filter) However from the spring integration documentation it specifies that the parameter is actually in milliseconds - ie the above XD configuration would recheck the script every 60 milliseconds which may be a performance concern as it will be checking the lastmodified time of the script file. Ideally this parameter would be configurable - in our case we would usually eliminate the refresh check altogether (set to -1) as our scripts will not change (or if they did a redeploy of the module would pick it up). This would allow multiple individual sink modules to be combined via the shell DSL so that each message sent to the composite sink module will be sent to each of the individual sink modules in turn. Internally this would probably use a recipient list router to send to each individual sink. Module options for each individual sink would be combined to create the overall options for the composite sink module in a similar way to existing composite modules. This would allow construction of streams with less communication with the message bus for example as an alternative to using a named topic in the message bus. Using this in conjunction with sinks built using existing composite module functionality (as a combination of processors and a sink) would allow more sophisticated combinations to be constructed and deployed as a single module (with no message bus One particular application of this would be with tap and counter functionality. If multiple fields in a message need counted this currently needs to be done as separate streams tapping the original with the overhead of the tapped message being read from the message bus multiple times potentially on different nodes, this enhancement would allow all the counters to be combined to make a more cohesive composite counter module so that the tapped message would only need to be read once.. Currently its possible to do this via but this involves an additional hop to the message bus for the pipe between the source and router. It would be better if this was supported directly with the existing named channel syntax to remove this pipe ie This would be useful as a possible solution in the scenario described in XD-3613 as an alternative to using topics on the Redis message bus which dont support having multiple instances of the same consumer.. Allow sending to multiple named channels at once. If I deploy more than one instance of a module (eg using 1 or 0) that consumes from a tap or topic then I get duplicate messages if Im using Redis as the message bus. It looks like this is the same issue as XD-3100 but the fix for that only fixed Rabbit as the message bus. This is easy to reproduce on a 2 container cluster using a Redis Message Bus: Create and deploy streams as follows: On container 1 send a message: Container 1 logs are then: and container 2: Ie the tapped message is duplicated (picked up by both tap module instances) Similarly for topics create and deploy these streams: On container 1 send a message: Container 1 logs are then: and container 2: Ie the topic message is picked up by each instance of the module in each stream. In this case I would expect each stream to pick up the message once ie I would get a single output for each stream test message 002 TOPIC CONSUMER 2 once (on either container) test message 002 TOPIC CONSUMER 1 once (on either container). I have a distributed XD Cluster with one admin and two containers using Redis as the message bus. In certain cases I want to use direct binding to remove communication with the message bus and deploy all modules to all containers with the aim of improving performance. Ive found that even when using direct binding, XD still communicates with Redis when it shouldnt need to. This could have an impact on performance. This is easily reproducible in our 2 container cluster as follows: Use the redis-cli monitor command to monitor Redis. Create and deploy a simple stream with direct binding: As expected both modules get deployed to both nodes. Testing shows messages sent to the http endpoint of one container always come out in the log for that container implying direct binding is in play as expected. However once the streams are deployed the Redis monitor starts showing a Redis queue being accessed from both XD conatiners: This shouldnt need to happen in direct binding. These messages stop once the stream is undeployed.. We have a use case where we need the HTTP source module to return a 204 status instead of the 200 status that is currently returned. There may be other status codes that it would be useful to be able to return. A simple additional option on the module would allow this to be configured.. ",7,886,5063
5,xd,dturanski,"User provides a jar file exposing a custom bean of type under the base package and installs it in xd lib. The XD runtime uses this bean during initialization to replace any property value containing the prefix from any properties source with the decrypted value.. Update SI, Spring, and AMQP dependencies. As a XD developer, I'd like to upgrade to SI Spring and AMQP dependencies, so I can take advantage of the latest improvements.. Ultimately module classes should themselves be a module so that testing a Source for example would use a TestSink and the message verified on the sink input(). This is currently a placeholder which includes: Corresponding Changes to the to eliminate and provide support for easily using the test's if necessary, test-specific annotations Refactor existing module test code. Replace with generic SI Components. Make requirement for MD5 hash files configurable for the custom module registry. Post upgrade, the custom modules no longer show up by just copying the jars to the directory. Instead I have to use the 'module upload' command to install the modules. This is because an MD5 file is required. More details in .. Move serialization codec from XD to Spring Integration. Rename binder properties. replace with prefix with. XD will not have direct dependency on the Binder (as MB has been renamed). The message bus code is in XD but some is required to support current integration tests. We can look at pruning it some more but complete removal likely depends on integrating the enabled Admin SPI. MB will remain in XD. Actually only the projects renamed. Class and package rename is TBD.. Copy to SCS as. This addresses The plugin issue to disable. Fail fast on Kryo registration conflicts. TupleCode should retain custom formatting settings. Refactor MessageBus to avoid unnecessary use of MessageBuilder. As a developer, I'd like to refactor the programmatic means by which the MessageBus transforms the Message so throughput performance can be optimized.. SCS - Verify Fix implementation. Accept any file name for top level module resources. Expecting in module configuration is brittle, especially in conjunction with module upload command which permits the module to be registered under a different name. The convention should be dropped in favor of any file name. This requires at most one and or in the top level config folder. It is an exception if multiples are found. Accepting any file name provides the most flexibility without sacrificing backward compatibility (except in rare cases in which a module developer may have violated the multiple xml or properties files condition). An alternate approach requiring a well known file name such as were rejected over concerns that it would break any existing custom module. Upgrade to Boot RELEASE and the dependencies. Add support for common dependent jars for modules. ModuleFactory is responsible for determining how the Module application context is created from available sources at the resource location exposed via the The factory creates the application context and creates a SimpleModule or as For example, if an XML file is present, it is assumed to be the bean definition file used to create a CXMLAC. If no XML file is present, inspect the properties file for the existence of well-known properties such as for component scanning for an or a for an Annotated POJO based module (see XD-2100). The MF is also responsible for creating composite modules. Also includes Module refactoring, add and probably Also refactor code to use boot. Create processor and sink modules that can ute a shell command using stdin and stdout to stream data.. Error message about memory leak when ctrl-c xd-container and xd-admin. How does not catch this?. Steps to verify: 1. Start XD (I verified both single node and distributed) 2. stream create test ""http log"" Use jolokia endpoint for container,. should also support end-user of the underlying MessageBus we have a customer requirement to enable configuration of the various RabbitMQ properties (for acks, txs, etc).. Currently the message bus is only obtained via Stream testing scenarios that depend on sending and receiving payloads via named channels do not require a deployed module instance per se, but any stream flow control uses the MessageBus directly. Getting a deployed module instance in general is expensive, you have to wait for the module to deploy whereas the MessageBus implementation could be known a priori when the application starts. An improvement would be to ask the container for its MessageBus.. Change default container port from 9000 to 8080. Change the default port since it conflicts with the default port for the http source. Investigate Swagger to generate REST API Documents. Enhance the stream parser to take message conversion into account in order to validate or automatically configure converters. For example: source sink is likely invalid since XD doesn't know how to convert Foo- Bar.. The ability to configure message conversion via parameters. Consider programatic configuration of data type channels. Values can be media type, or a java class name.. Twitter search source should produce JSON or Pojo. The Pojo requires a custom wrapper class that is JSON friendly zero arg constructor). The twittersearch module should have a parameter true false (default true) to control the output type.. provide a property on twittersearch to enable the transformer. MBeanServer should not be declared in module common configuration. Should be simple to test in isolation but also across transports (stream testing). String - byte byte - byte (no serialization) Pojo - configured serialization. The documented gemfire-cq example ( fails: create cqtest ""gemfire-cq ^. Add Server Runtime Info to Banner. Since most of the will do more then one thing (deploy a stream, start it, add a tap, add a job, stop, etc) we decided to decouple writing testcases with running it. Test cases will be written in spring-shell scriptlets. Scriptlets are json files with command and expectedResult as tokens. Here's an example: A parser will parse scriptlets, utes it and asserts on expected results.. Add conversion support to and. User wants to configure MessageBus. Used to track necessary refactoring or design review tasks. Technical Debt. - Container context should be separate from Admin Context in local mode (consistency across transports). Provide a to bridge deploy and undeploy channels to the ModuleDeployer - Verify Plugins are not in common module context. They are only needed by the ModuleDeployer not the Modules. - Add global-beans Config for beans to be shared among admin and container (and available to modules). This would be set as the parent context where needed. (Currently and JobRepository shared by Admin and modules) - Fix ModuleDeployer sets parentContext twice - Rename to NOTE: Analytics parent only required in local mode - Write unit tests to verify configurations are as expected. Correct bean and no stray beans or redundant instances where not needed - Decouple Command options from System properties (in general XD property names), this gives us some flexibility in mapping to properties or profiles where appropriate. Clean up Spring Configuration. Add create() and deploy() to TapsController. Examples: 1. Be able to start the rabbitmq source just by pointing to pass in some property file for parameters to be replaced, and outgoing message is placed in a in-memory queue backed channel for use with assertions to verify functionality. 2. Test for as many source types as is 'reasonable', MQTT TCP testing might be harder than say rabbitmq. 3. Test that sending json, results in media-type header is set to json 4. Test that sending POJO, "" POJO 5. Test that sending Tuple, "" Tuple 6. Test that sending raw bytes, "" raw bytes. Be able to point to the processor xml file, and have access to a source channel that drives messages into the processor and a output channel where output messages are send.

To send a pre-set message to process(es). The command line for xd-admin and xd-container to support an additional option, pipeProtocol, that is used to determine the middleware for sending admin requests and data between processing steps. A Flow or a processor component may require routing semantics. Currently the stream assumes a single input and output for each module.

10,xd,dokeeffe,"In our system we have built quite a few custom modules. It is currently possible for the end user to mess up the configuration of these custom modules when creating multiple streams. They can create conflicting configuration in multiple streams. The conflicting config is nothing to do with spring-xd itself, it is related to our data flow and business process. It would be nice to have some sort of that I could implement and write my custom validation code. If this decides that the stream definition is not valid (according to my rules) then it could stop the deployment of a stream. The validator would need to be aware of the other streams somehow.. SpringXD's syslog source cannot parse rfc5424 messages into a Map. For the messages we get in RFC 3164, springXD converts these to a Map. Since the rfc5424 data cannot be interpreted then the map contains just one key called 'UNDECODED'. The result of this is that we get a string that looks like this (when we convert the message to a String) Should be something like this (note the values below are for illustrative purposes only and should not be used as test data) h3. Root Cause Spring integration does not parse these messages. There is a JIRA for SI here:. Enhance the current jdbchdfs job in spring-xd to have an incremental load delta load feature similar to sqoop. See sqoop documentation . The job will need to maintain some state between utions in order to decide the start point for the next data load. The jdbchdfs job definition could take the following 2 new options. h5. checkColumn optional Specifies the column to be examined when determining which rows to import. (the column should not be of type Column should be numeric or timestamp. h5. lastValue optional If specified this will override any data saved from previous job runs. If not specified will take the saved max-value from the last job run. If no last job run data is available then it will not be an incremental load and all the data which satisfies the query will be used. Sqoop provides 2 modes of operation for incremental load, 'append' and For jdbchdfs the job will always append as it is writing to a hdfs file. Example: To import data from the database table some table which has a last update column called lastUpdated, you could use. The batch job should also be capable of being partitioned to run in parallel across multiple containers. Exception in a tap will stop the tapped stream from sinking data. h2. Background Running xd-singlenode. We experienced this when streaming data from a rabbit queue to hdfs. The stream was tapped and we had a groovy processor on the tap stream. Any exceptions in the processor stopped the main stream from writing data to the hdfs sink. h2. Steps to reproduce. 1: Create a groovy script that throws an exception in Code below 2: Create a sample main stream 3: Tail the log to confirm the data is going to the sink. We see appearing in the log as expected. 4: Add a tap to the stream that will throw an exception. 5: Tail the log and we see that there are no more strings being logged. Looks like the main stream is no longer sending messages to the sink.. ",4,558,3131

Starting teh shell without having admin running on results in the following message: Running gives a nasty stacktrace though, so these instructions are misleading and should be changed. Sqoop list-tables doesn't work oob. Add support for using Sqoop metastore. The hdfs sink doesn't recover after error writing to hdfs. Steps to reproduce - create a stream using hdfs sink with a small rollover: stop the datanode(s) and wait for an exception like: start the datanode(s) again, the sink never recovers and has to be undeployed and redeployed.. Update to SHDP for fixing hdfs store writer to recover after error writing to hdfs. As a build manager, I'd like to have Spring XD RPMs published in repository so that users can directly download the bits without having to go through appsuite repo or the EULA.. I'm running a jdbchdfs job with 8 partitions and 2 containers. Some steps complete ok while some (3-4 on average) fail with a connection pool error (see below). This happens with a decent size table rows). I tried two different databases - Oracle 11g on a separate server and MySQL running locally where the XD containers where running. Same pattern with both databases.. Frequent connection pool errors with jdbchdfs jobs. Create a Batch example to demonstrate JDBC- HDFS. Having problems testing against the Sandbox We need to set the following properties:. Make Sqoop job and MapReduce samples work with Hortonworks HDP single-node cluster. XD should use same hadoop security keys as Spring for Apache Hadoop. Add an ""xd-yarn info"" command to list admin servers and ports. As a user deploying XD on YARN I need a convenient way to get info like the admin port for my current deployment. Best way, for now, would be to add an info command to the xd-yarn script. With the latest changes the admin server runs on a random port when we deploy to YARN. In order for the user to connect they would have to query Zookeeper. This is inconvenient.. The Sqoop tasklet introduced an implementation in XD-2430. We are now adding similar support to Batch in BATCH-2329, BATCH-2330 and BATCH-2331. We should refactor Sqoop and Spark tasklets to use the as base.. Refactor Spark and Sqoop tasklets to use. Upgrade to Spring Boot. As to prepare for release, we would like to upgrade to Spring Boot (RC) (depends on Spring so that we can leverage the new features, enhancement and bug fixes.. The jdbc sink is currently limited to handling the entire payload as a string and converting a single json object to row data. We should improve that and support the following input types: - (single row) - List (multiple rows as a batch insert) - JSON string (single row) - JSON array (multiple rows as a batch insert) - none of the above use The above matches what the new jdbc source puts out (depending on outputType used). Looks like the isn't used when compressing files with bzip2, some use cases requirer bz2 instead of bzip2 as the extension. Also, should be the default extension.

Clean up duplicated dependencies from XD on YARN installation. Going forward it seems that providing Hadoop v1 will be of lesser importance and we might as well drop it now. SHDP will also drop any v1 support. Remove support for: - hadoop12 - Apache Hadoop - cdh4 - Cloudera CDH - hdp13 - Hortonworks Data Platform Keep: - hadoop22 - Apache Hadoop (default) - phd1 - Pivotal HD - phd20 - Pivotal HD - cdh5 - Cloudera CDH - hdp21 - Hortonworks Data Platform This should make configuration and documentation easier too. Not to mention testing. This affects startup scripts and the shell plus the build script.. New job that utes SQL script using JDBC. Each Hadoop distro uses different settings for and we should provide some starting points for the distros we support running XD on YARN for. We should add a commented out stub entry for phd20, cdh5 and hdp21 to replace the one for hadoop22 when someone deploys on these distros.. We should add an easy way to configure the memory. Currently we only have the number of YARN containers configurable without diving into Spring YARN Boot specific config options. Proposing we do:. Not sure why the Hadoop classes are on the admin servers classpath. There is no way to select the distro, and the Hadoop classes shouldn't be needed except for module info for hdfs sink (see XD-1701). Add configuration for the partition strategy to HDFS sink to support writing files into subdirectories based on a partition key provided in the header or field in the message of the stream data. The writing using HDFS Store DataWriter should pass in the partition key value to be used for the write operation. Partition configuration could be made available to the sink using a parameter: that could then be used in XML config like: Similar to the time source.. When starting and stopping xd containers there are entries left in the directory that will cause 'runtime modules' command to fail. modules Command failed KeeperErrorCode NoNode for here the container is no longer running, but there is some data left over..

Switch driver for Redis. The Spring Data team recommends using the Jedis driver since the Lettuce driver hasn't had any update activity for several months. Jedis is actively maintained. We might also want to investigate Redisson which is a fork of Lettuce -. Add way to provide module config options for XD on YARN. There seems to be some intersection with the work for this issue and the of how module properties are handled. There will be changes to management support such that each module (source, sink, etc) will be able to also be overridden in (or wherever points to. The HDFS sink module for example, will have default values based on it's and will be of the form .. That means in the configuration for sink, there would be a config section such as With default values defined by a class. The module file would not contain any references to a properties file. A file specified by could override the values in a config section such as sink: hdfs: : : etc.. Add YARN specific code based on Janne's prototyping Add YARN Client and AppMaster and startup config files This includes shell scripts to deploy XD to YARN Test working on Apache distribution We can modify config files, everything should be possible to override by providing command-line args or env variables.. Add XD deployment for YARN. Rename avro sink to hdfs-dataset and add support for parquet format. Create EC2 AMI for single-node install of Cloudera CDH. hdfsjdbc throws an exception: The hdfsjdbc job uses 'columns' instead of 'names' as the parameter for the column-names. Should we make this usage consistent between jobs? There is a comment in the docs - ""there is also a limitation in that the database table must be created manually. This is due to a bug in Spring Hadoop and will be fixed in the Think this is this solved in Spring Hadoop now? should default to false now to be consistent with jdbc sink Rename to since these aren't just for import. filejdbc throws an exception: This can be solved by using a prefix Maybe just update the docs?. In the shell: job launch doesn't do completion of this is different behavior compared to job destroy typing 'job destroy' and hitting tab completes with ' typing 'job launch' and hitting tab does nothing. The batch jobs use different defaults compared to some of the sink source modules. filehdfs puts data in a data directory with files named after the stream using a .log file extension. The hdfs sink puts files in an xd directory using .txt as the default file extension. filehdfs needs a more descriptive naming. Align filehdfs batch job defaults with those of corresponding hdfs sink. Update to when it is released and remove the temporary in We should also review the supported hadoop distros - think we should support anything that is - hadoop12 - hadoop22 - phd1 (PHD - hdp13 - hdp20 - cdh4. The HDFS Sink should support writing POJOs to HDFS using Parquet. Support writing lines of text separated by a delimiter Support writing a CSV variables), TSV (tab-separated variables), No compression. We used to have a shared dependency in the lib dir. That's no longer there so hadoop distros that require this now fail (at least any hadoop based ones) We should also upgrade to current Hadoop versions (Hadoop stable). The HDFS Sink should support compressing files as they are copied. The HDFS Sink should support copying File payloads. We should support payloads in order to support non-textual file and large text file payloads being uploaded to HDFS. Currently text file payloads are converted to a text stream in memory and, non-String payloads are converted to JSON first, using an Ultimately we need to support streams such as ""file hdfs"" where the actually payload being copied to HDFS is not necessarily JSON or textual. Need to be able to support headers in the message that will indicate which HDFS file the data should be stored in.. We should adjust our options to the ones supported in the new - hadoop12 (default), cdh4, hdp13, phd1, hadoop20 This includes updating the wiki pages. Fix classpath error caused by multiple conflicting servlet-api jars. Create script to extract table data from JSON based on a given HAWQ table structure. Provide n strategy interface to obtain the key used when writing SequenceFiles. Writing POJOs using CDK Data (Avro) We should support both partitioned and un-partitioned Write POJO using - un-partitioned - partitioned date Document limitations in terms of which Java types are supported and not supported by the Avro serialization. The HDFS Sink should support writing POJOs to HDFS using Avro Serialization. The HDFS Sink should support a number of rollover options. The HDFS Sink should support a file naming strategy to distinguish between file currently being written and completed files.

Currently I believe we only mention labels in this section of the doc: And it is not even clear there that they are when 2 or more module names would otherwise be ambiguous. It was probably written before we made that a mandatory part of the definition. We should mention this somewhere in the 'streams' section of the manual. Even if none of the examples there currently have more than one occurrence of the same module, we should add one to illustrate this point.. Composed Module currently behave as ""white boxes"". As soon as a module is composed (say ""http filter"") then all options of the children modules are available (as and in the example above). Change this so that a composed module is a black box: user has to explicitly expose an option for it to be available (most certainly using a short name). Hardcoding of values would be retained (and possibly overridable).

Also likely rename, remove, or replace that Module (maybe can be supplanted by when used in the refactored parser). Also, considering the ""url"" property is not necessary (vestige of the prototype), all we'd be left with here is the Module name and type, which are used to identify a Module uniquely. Therefore this Module could be renamed to ModuleKey or something. It could be used within the itself. The two classes in question are: The former is currently used by the Admin when making decisions about Module deployment. That latter was a replacement for as we migrated the various Redis InMemory Repositories to use the data that is now available in ZooKeeper instead. The is currently used by the Admin leader, and the is used by the REST endpoint that supports the xd-shell's 'runtime containers' command. Perhaps those can also be merged. In any case, if not addressed by a larger refactoring, the should probably support an Iterable return rather than an Iterator. Having finders for attribute key values such as might be convenient for various Module deployment strategies.. We should also consider explicit methods such as parseStream (so that parseJob and are at least separate methods, if not separate parser classes that share the common parser support class that is the core of today's parser). The parsing for ""completion providers"" should probably be spun off to its own class as well.

Validate time field processing with. The Admin leader will write each Module deployment request to a child node of for a selected Container (see XD-1399). That (persistent) child node needs to be created by the Container at the same time as it creates its ephemeral node under The Container should then deploy the Module. If that same node is subsequently deleted, the Container should undeploy the Module.. The Stream deployment requests will be written to and the data on that node will include the state or a boolean indicator (for now) of whether it should be deployed. When a Stream is deployed, the leader will consult its Container cache and write the modules to the various child nodes (see XD-1400).. This should also enable removal of any code. The state should be written as a data node at the stream level ) For now we at least need to support the boolean flag. If that is true, then the leader Admin will deploy the modules of the stream across available containers (XD-1399). Admin leader should watch Container nodes in ZooKeeper. The xd containers node is the parent where each Container will write an ephemeral child node. The node name should be the Container's ID, and the node data should be the Container's attributes (host, pid, and much more to be added later). When a Container shuts down cleanly, it should eagerly delete the ephemeral node so that watchers are notified immediately. For any other case (including a network partition), the ephemeral node will disappear after the timeout elapses.. Rename or reconsider the command.

19,xd,mminella,"button in the UI continues to launch the job composition * Relevant unit tests included to simulate various scenarios. h2. Narrative As the system, I would like a way to launch a previously deployed job module from another job module. h2. Back story For the composed job story, we will have a driver job that consists of each step that represents the ution of a job. This story is the creation of a that will launch the child job, and upon it's completion, set the results of the driver's step to that of the slave job's results.. h2. Narrative As Spring XD, I will be able to launch Spring Boot jar files as Diego Tasks. h2. Back story The will be responsible for listening for launch requests, looking up the definition in the , and launching it. The first implementation of this would be a Receptor based. Provide the ability to chain jobs together via enhancing the DSL. The chain of jobs should be launchable as a single unit (filejdbc, mycustomjob, and jdbchdfs are all job modules):. h2. Narrative As a developer, I'd like a job module to be bootstrapped when the job is launched and shut down once it is complete instead of the current behavior of bootstrapping the context when the module is deployed regardless of if it's being used so that I can achieve better resource utilization. h2. Back story While streams are never ending, batch jobs have a true lifecycle with a beginning and and end. By having a job bootstrapped when it's not uting, it eats up precious resources. For example, if I have a job that creates connections to a database via a connection pool, the job module will hold those connections from the moment it's deployed to the moment it's undeployed, even if the job isn't being uted. A more efficient use of resources would be to have the job module provide just enough to receive the launch request and then bootstrap the job's context h2. Notes. h3. Narrative As a developer, I need to be able to create a Spring XD job module that consists of a job orchestrating the ution of other Spring Batch jobs using the Spring Batch Job Step (see section here: within the same module definition. h3. Acceptance Criteria Define the ""contract"" for a job module Currently the contract consists of a single job definition within the assembled (). The new version will need to document what job definition within the assembled should be run as the entry point. I'm assuming it would be by id ( for example) of the job but am open to other options. A custom job module that orchestrates multiple Spring Batch jobs via Job steps should be able to be deployed and uted as a single Spring XD module. Spring XD launches the job that conforms to the previously defined ""contract"". Spring Batch manages the ution of the child jobs. The existing OOTB jobs should work under the new ""contract"". h3. Assumptions The UI should ""just work"" in that child jobs update the job repository independently so no updates should be needed for an MVP of this functionality. h3. Out of Scope Execution of child jobs that are remote (deployed on another node ). Dynamically assembling jobs via the shell's DSL or the UI.. When deploying a batch job, the UI displays the database password found in the in plain text to the user. At the very least, this should be displayed in a password field so it's masked out and have it masked out in the resulting definition at the bottom of the page. Ideally, we wouldn't provide the password on that page at all and only accept overriding options (if the user wants a password other than the configured one, enter itotherwise, we'll use what we have). I'm finding that this occurs in other places as well. A full pass though of the UI should be done to mask out passwords (or eliminate their display all together).. There seems to be some inconsistency with the naming strategy for the named channels. For example: If we create a job ""j1"", the job launching request queue name in the message broker would . To send a launching request, we can either use or (both seems to work). If we create a stream with the named p2p channel ""foo"" we expect to use the syntax and the message broker will have the queue name The resolves the source sink channel names for tap to deduce the module index from the channel component: env) But, in case of the named channels that have prefix or their names are used as is the only exception in a case where (From tapAllowed) The above code makes sure, still points . We need some consistency when referring to the names of queues for the named channels above. Something like this: for job launching request queue and for the named p2p channel queue or, a better strategy the has consistency across the named channels.. h2.

MongoDb driver is present on DIRT's classpath, while it should not (should be present on mongo-related modules though). This is blocked by the shortcoming described here:. Kafka Bus: Add support for ACK mode. Kafka Bus: Add suppor for async vs. sync producer. Kafka Bus: Concurrency and compression support. Decouple messagebus dependencies. * Message bus dependencies The goal is to decouple them from startup phase to further enhance initialization time.. Composed Module currently behave as ""white boxes"". As soon as a module is composed (say ""http filter"") then all options of the children modules are available (as and in the example above). Change this so that a composed module is a black box: user has to explicitly expose an option for it to be available (most certainly using a short name). Hardcoding of values would be retained (and possibly overridable). Possible syntaxes :. Add support for user-defined permission to role mapping. As a user, I'd like to have the option to configure permissions so that I'll have the flexibility to bind permissions (REST endpoint) to a specific role. Default Roles: Viewer (R). Add support to configure security definitions via Admin UI (ACL). Add support to configure security definitions via Shell (ACL). Add support to define granular security definitions by entity (ACL). Once is merged, improve in the following areas: add options for - concurrency - compression support - async vs. sync producer - ACK mode Build on top of wrt the partition header to use (see. stream create foo ""label: bar xxxx"" stream deploy foo seems to work but it does not.

The Tap fixture does not need to inherit from Replace moduleName method with moduleToTap. The current tap syntax is: and not as currently implemented by the label fixture.. Tap Fixture does not need to inherit from. Just as a stream or a job may state its needs and preferences for container assignment using the 'criteria' or 'rank' expressions, the xd-containers themselves can specify needs and preferences using the same 'critera' and 'rank' expressions.

Update doc about trigger changes. Switch to style in application config. Provide cmdline options validation. Migrating to boot dropped the XD banner and its info. Can be restored using eg a boot Initializer and removing the default boot banner. Remove existing 'purpose built' json processors and ensure all functionality is still available with jsonPath based SpEL expression based processors. This would be a combination of the existing aggregate counter and field value counter functionality. For example if the stream data was for car purchases some fields might be colour, make and model. When analysing the aggregate data I dont just want to know how many were sold on Monday, but how many of each make or how many of each colour, or how many of a particular colour, make AND model. This would allow a dashboard type client to 'drill down' into each dimension or combination of dimensions (in real time without uting batch queries against the raw data) Ideally the aggregate counter would be specified as stream create mytap The keys would be dynamically created according to the field values in each record (ie in a similar way to the field value counter you would not need to predefine field values) and keys would be created for all combinations of the fields specified eg the record would increment the following key counters (in addtion to the existing time buckets) ie the actual keys would look something like etc This may seem like it would generate a lot of key combinations but in practice the data generated will still be massively less than the raw data, and keys will only be created if that combination occurs in a time period. Also some fields may be dependent on each other (such as make and model in the above example) so the amount of possibilites for those composite keys would be a lot less that the number of one times the number of the other.. Create project for model that is common between client and server. Encapsulate list of within a parsed Stream result object. See also XD-903, XD-915 A lot of dependencies have been added with the ""compile"" scope as an oversight over time. Some of them are only required at runtime, some may not be required anymore.. File source should be able to produce file contents or file reference. Remove existing 'purpose built' json processors and replace with documentation using jsonPath functionality. Execute hadoop script in service activator. Apart from sanity checks, there is not much that ties to actual Using the Resource abstraction would work just the same, and would allow loading modules from the classpath in constrained environments CF YARN. Gemfire modules should support connection via locator. Create separate commands for "" shell commands. This came up when working on email source.

Parser needs to handle a embedded in a name.. Remove unnecessary code that adds beans to shared context after refresh Scheduler should not be in - register it in. stack overflow when trying to create a stream with the same name as a module. Ugly error messages in shell when not connected. Gemfire cache closed when a gemfire module is undeployed. Start of a test program that can be placed in In the test program see two taps. One using the older style and one using the newer style and ' ' so that there is no real tap module source, the log module just gets its input channel wired directly to (the output of transform). They should be doing the same thing. However when run the output for tap new is missing, all I see is: No errors are reported, there is just no output for tap new.. Seems like the current file source results from an initial POC. Very few things can be parameterized, including the polled directory that needs to be in tmp xxx To be useful in production, we might want to revisit. Refactor analytics to get rid of Services. If a job is created that uses a trigger that has not been created and deployed it throws a 500 error instead of a 400. Favor using custom exceptions instead of using review usage and make changes.

Create stories to enable the use of Spring Shell's branch testing facilities. The stream definition is not deleted in redis container when the stream is destroyed. There's a lifecycle problem when a tap creation fails because the DSL syntax is wrong). Subsequent attempts to create the tap will fail with an error: Disabling JMX solves the issue. reproduce Create a bad stream definition name 'bad' Try to recreate with the same name, but correct stream definitions. The system will report that the stream already exists.. Add a header to responses in order to support cross-origin requests. Update Source Syslog section to use Shell commands instead of curl. Update Sources Gemfire CQ section to use Shell commands instead of curl. The documentation in the Running in Distributed Mode chapter should discuss that the distributed runtime can use essentially any middleware to communicate between nodes. This functionality is provided by the core abstraction. A new intro paragraph shoul convey that it isn't a 'redis' only or 'rabbitmq' only system. There should be ""Installing RabbitMQ"" and ""Starting RabbitMQ"" sections to match those for Redis.

Retrieve monitoring information for a specfied module. Add RabbitMQ-based implementation of ChannelRegistry. Links in asciidoctor generated HTML+docbook documentation are broken.

I guess what could work is to have the macro (either override the link macro or create our own if github supports that) that looks like : (the anchor works out of the box in asciidoc and should work in github) but override it for the html and docbook backends to render to the correct form. The thing is, there are several ways to macros (and templates they render to), some of which make sense to our setup: - having in the directory of the processed document ( - having in the directory of the processed document ( - defining macros using attributes ( I tried all of those, but to no avail.

24,xd,CalamarBicefalo,"At the moment, a custom module can not be upgraded at all, it's not only a desired story, as stated in . It's indeed a major issue, since the only way to upgrade a module is by destroying the previous version first. However a module can not be destroyed if it's being used in existing streams, which means there is no way (at least using shell utilities) to upgrade once spring-xd is in production. Because destroying streams is simply not an option. What is even more annoying, if some default configuration is included in conf folder. The module can't be upgraded unless that configuration is previously removed, which makes everything even more inconvenient, because in order to upgrade custom modules, SpringXD requires you to: Remove all streams using that module Remove existing configuration Destroy the existing module Upload the new version Re-create the previously removed configuration Re-create all destroyed streams Re-deploy all previously deployed streams.. At the moment, the correlation expression in the aggregator module only takes into consideration the incoming message rather than the whole existing collected messages so far + the incoming message. It would be great to gain access to the whole collection apart from the incoming message so messages could be correlated in a way such as: Collect 1 (and only one) message of each type, if we have fruits, for example we may want to get one pear, and one banana aggregated per basket, and we want to release a basket once it's ready. If we receive 100 bananas, we want to prepare 100 baskets and wait for pears to arrive so our fruity baskets can be released.

Add an option to destroy the stream job definitions. Also add confirm action that asks for user to confirm to proceed with destroy.. After successful job deployment, the Job deployments path in ZK doesn't get updated with the data Though this data is not used for deployed instance repository to check for the deployment status, it may be better to have this state updated like stream deployment path.. Upon container departure, the onChildLeft() event triggers redeployment of stream job modules that were deployed into the leaving container. During the redeployment, it happens that the container candidates from the (based on the subset from candidates, int count)) includes the container which already have the module of the stream job definition deployed.

Would this behavior change if we switch to distributed mode ? I know that a GC pause of 29 secs is really long, however, I've already seen such pauses for batch systems pretty often. Long running jobs tend to move objects to older generations and sometimes there isn't much of a chance to do something against it. So I guess it's worth considering this in the behavior of XD ?.

36,xd,thomasd,"A module developer can specify a general description with hyperlinks for a module. A module user can see the description via . A REST API consumer should be able to access the general module description as well.. It should be possible to configure a (short) description for a module that is display above the module options via . The description could contain a few lines describing the core functionality and potentially hyperlinks to additional information for a module. This information should be exposed via the REST interface as well. Currently only the module options are printed.. Often one has to perform some basic conversion parsings in Stream definitions. It would be helpful if one could provide some helper functions to simplify SpEL expressions. instead of: it would be nice to be able to write: I'm thinking of support for: parseInt parseLong parseDouble parseTuple (I don't think we'd need support for This issue is about: 1) providing the centralised infrastructure for defining the SpEL expressions 2) Add support for the above listed predefined SpEL expressions Those functions should be able to work with String based as well as as input.. The current representation of REST resources of time-series data aggregate counter) can lead to problems in consuming applications. Despite the time series data provided by the ""counts"" data structure is logically ordered by key (timestamps) it doesn't guarantee an ordering, since many consuming applications interpret JSON data as an unordered map like data structure. Because of this consuming applications have to apply special ordering transformation logic to get the data in an ordered fashion. It would be helpful if one could configure the rendering of the time series data, as a list of json object like: Where denotes the timestamp and denotes the value. It would also be helpful if one could adjust the date format either with a pattern or a well known date format like, . I attached a python example for this that demonstrates the problem. Steps to reproduce: Create stream Create tap on stream with Post some http data Display aggregate counter Install python Requests library (REST support) Start a python console (or and run the following program: The above program should result in a similar output, but as one can see, due to pythons interpretation of the JSON object as a dict, the order of the keys in the output got mixed up. Instead of showing the counts and then 1 as in the example above. This is just one example of how the current representation of the rest resource could lead to problems in consuming applications.. Often it is useful to have access to the median value for fields of a data stream since they are more robust with respect to outliers. The median is defined as the value of a dataset such that, when sorted, 50% of the data is smaller than the value and 50% of the data is larger then the value. Ordinarily this is difficult to calculate on a stream because it requires the collection and sorting of all data. The median of a data stream can be approximated with a technique called stochastic averaging. To approximate the median value of a data stream one could use the following approach: Given the current estimate of the median . If the next observed value in the stream is larger than , increase the current estimate by ( the learning rate). If it is smaller, decrease the estimate by . When is close to the median, it increases as often as it decreases, and therefore it stabilizes. The following example shows a primitive implementation of the above mentioned algorithm in groovy (to be placed under Stream definition: Post some JSON Output: After the median value should stabilize. This approach was taken from the book ""Real-time Analytics - Techniques to Analyze and Visualize Streaming Data"" P. 296 Byron Ellis Wiley Open points: - Support for resetting the median value - Better state management (Redis?) - Support median estimation for multiple fields - Make learning rate configurable from outside - Maybe add this as aggregation strategy?. In some scenarios like when performing exploratory data-analysis on streaming data one often create a stream, keep it running for some time (or until some condition is met) and then stop the stream and start to investigate the collected data. It would be cool to be able to specify some undeploy condition, like a timeout after x minutes, no. of events collected, a specific counter past a given threshold, file-size greater then x etc..

Instead of putting all libs in one directory and an XML in another, it could be a fat jar including some metadata file pointing to either an XML or to a JavaConfig configuration class inside the jar. Some more words why I think it's important to have something like that: Spring XD can be very well used in the enterprise, and at least for job modules it's likely to have some dependencies. So what do you have to do now to deploy such a module? Build a jar with your build process, then get it from your repository, unpack it and somehow find the relevant XML to copy it into the appropriate folder, then inspect the POM to find out what all the dependencies are, direct and transient, and get them from your repository to copy them into the appropriate folder. And of course, copy the jar. And when using Spring XD in distributed mode, you have to do it several times.

Confirmation All related Jira items should be marked as won't fix. NOTE: This is technically a BREAKING CHANGE. h2. Card The What's New module is used to display the change log for DNN releases. The core platform no longer maintains the change long in the What's New module and uses the Getting Started feature instead. The What's New module should be deleted. This module does not have it's own API or database structures so there is no backend to consider. h2. Conversation h2. Confirmation All related Jira items should be marked as won't fix.. h2.

The module manifest was updated to include a method for creating admin host page when a module is installed. The method used was to add nodes to the Module component which defined the page. This should be updated to include all of the page sub-elements in a single Page element. The component should include the ability to define whether the page is a host page or admin page. It should include the ability to flag whether a module appears in the common or advanced sections of the menu. The page name, icon file(s) and description should be included as elements withing the component. An example entry would look like: A page type must be defined as either admin or host (case insensitive). The common flag will default to false if not defined. The name is the only required element in the page element. The ""common"" flag should be stored as a ""term"" on the page and the control panel should use this ""term"" to determine what gets displayed in the common section. The manifest section of the Wiki should be updated to reflect the manifest changes. ! Confirmation This requires updating all existing admin modules to use the new format..

Confirmation. Create file type permissions manager. h2. Card As an super-user, I would like to be able to set upload permissions on file-types. I should be able to delegate management of individual file types to administrators and lock other file types to only be manageable by super-users. As an administrator, I want to be able to assign upload permissions to users or roles for file-types which have been delegated by a super-user. h2. Conversation The system should come with a set of pre-defined file extensions as defined by our current Host Extensions list. All file types will initially be manageable by super-users with the exception of the following types: jpg, jpeg, mpg, mpeg, mp4, wmv, mov, gif, png, svg, doc, docx, ppt, pptx, xls, xlsx, pdf, txt, xml. The image and movie file types (jpg, jpeg, mpg, mpeg, mp4, wmv, mov, gif, png) will have an initial permission which includes the registered user role. h2. Confirmation This should be built as a SPA module.. h2. Card As a module developer, I want to be able to automatically create an admin or host tab during module installation and have the module automatically added to that page. h2. Conversation The developer should be able to use the DNN manifest to automatically create the appropriate page. Page permissions should be automatically set based on the menu and should not require configuration in the manifest. The module should be able to set a flag to determine if the page is displayed in the common or advanced settings sections of the Admin Host menu. IF an admin page is defined, then it should be created for all portals in the current The manifest logic should detect if the page already exists and if the module already exists on the page. h2. Confirmation Uninstall of the module should delete the associated page if this is the only module on the page. This will require modifying all of the existing Admin Modules which have already been packaged.. h2. Card The Configuration Manager is used for managing configuration files for a DNN installation. The Configuration Manager is just a UI that exists over the top of the core platform APIs.

It is intended as a navigation aid for the host and admin menus. The UI components and all API and database artifacts should be extracted into a separate module. h2. Conversation This initial conversion effort is only focused on conversion to a module and shall not include conversion to a MVC or SPA module. This should be marked as a system module. h2. Confirmation. h2. Card The Vendors Module is used for managing vendors and banners within DNN. The vendors and banners modules, APIs and database structures should be removed from the core platform and extracted into a standalone solution consisting of the Vendors module and a Banners module. The Banners module will have a dependency on the Vendors module. The vendors module should create a page on the Admin menu when installed. h2. Conversation This initial conversion effort is only focused on conversion to a module and shall not include conversion to a MVC or SPA module. This module will move to a separate GitHub project in the organization. We can drop stored procedures, but should not remove the tables in the core platform. Install of this module should check to ensure the table is not dropped. h2. Confirmation Note: This is a BREAKING CHANGE. h2.

Card As an administrator, I want to be able to create a new workflow. h2. Conversation When I click the ""Create Workflow"" in the main screen, the workflow creation screen should expand open at the top of the workflow list. The Workflow creation screen should include a Workflow Name and a Workflow Description. There should be a save and cancel button at the bottom of the panel. Clicking cancel, closes the panel and resets the fields on the panel to empty. Clicking save creates a new workflow and closes the panel. The workflow list is then refreshed. A new workflow should include a Draft and Published state.. h2. Card As an viewer, I want to be able to view content. h2. Conversation Content should be displayed using the selected content-type, and view-template If a content editor has not configured the module then the module should initially be displayed using an HTML content type and a ""Getting Started"" template. This should be a standard Global Template which is installed with the DCC. h2. Confirmation. Quick Settings view for DCC. h2. Card As a content manager, I want to be able to set the content type, view template and edit templates for a specific instance of the DCC viewer module. h2. Conversation The Content Type drop down list should display all of the portal and global types available in the current portal. The view template drop down list should display all the view templates associated with a specific content type. The edit template drop down list should display all of the view templates associated with a specific content type. In addition, the edit template list will include an option to use an auto-generated view. The auto-generated option will be the default option. If there is a file that matches the following pattern then it should be the default edit view: For example, if you have a view template named then file named will automatically be selected if it exists, otherwise the auto-generated option will be the default value. If the current module does not have any settings configured, then the view should show an informational message at the top of the view notifying the user that they need to configure the module. h2. Conversation. h2. Card As an administrator, I want to have a link from the module action menu to the Dynamic Content Type Management page. h2. Conversation It can't be assumed that the Dynamic Content Type Management module exists on an admin page. The system should be able to find whatever page wherever it is located in the system. This should open with the Templates tab open. It should enforce the permissions. h2. Confirmation. Edit Content using Auto-Generated Edit template. h2. Card As an administrator, I want to be able to quickly access a simple set of module specific settings. h2. Conversation A developer should be able to define a view that is used for displaying the quick settings. Quick settings should be definable for user controls, razor scripts, and html views. Quick settings should be displayed in their own drop down that is rendered as part of the Module Action Menu. This menu should only be displayed if the module includes a quick settings view. Quick settings should not use a postback but should rely on AJAX interactions. Quick settings should automatically be displayed when a module is first added to a page. h2. Confirmation. Create Quick Settings Framework. At this point a user can copy all the template code and then paste it into our text area and create a template. I think it'd be a useful improvement to add the ability to upload existing templates in the ""Create Template"" tab. Templates should be uploaded to the correct location.. So with our Dynamic Content Type Manager we have a pagination built into and set at 5 items per page. This is OK if you're only using 5 - 10 Content Data Types or Templates When you start have dozens, like 15 or more, this means you could be left clicking 3 or more times to find a Content Data Type or Template. Could we not add a page drop down as we have in Event Viewer, File Manager, etc? If we did this Lorraine would need to document the additional functionality Confirmation This should be implemented as a dropdown list as part of pager. By default we should have sizes for 10, 25 and 50 items.. h2. Card As a content type editor, I want to be able to easily insert the code for a specific razor helper into a template that I am editing. h2. Conversation There should be a context menu which allows you to insert the code for common razor helpers at current cursor location. This should include HTML helpers, DNN helpers and Custom Helpers. HTML and DNN helpers should be defined in a host specific config file which is located in the folder. Custom helpers will be defined in a portal specific config file which is located in the portals config folder. The helper config file should use the basic Visual Studio Code Snippet file format ( The initial release version will only support the header title and the snippets code block, however, any valid snippet file should be readable. If the title block or code block contains a token then that resource key should be used to localize the text. The associated resource files should be located in folder contained in the config folder. h2. Confirmation. Add row highlight on hover to grids. h2. Card In the Content Type, Data Type, and Content Field grids, the row should be highlighted in light blue on hover. In addition, highlighted row should include a down arrow icon as indicated when a grid uses ""in grid editing"" if the grid expands for editing then show the arrow, if the user gets a ""new"" page for editing then don't show the arrow) Clicking on a row should default to the same behavior as clicking on the edit icon for that row. If a row expands, then the row should remain highlighted and clicking the row a second time should cancel the edit and close the row. The up-arrow for closing an expanded row is only shown on hover. See the attached screenshots for examples of this behavior. h2. Conversation h2. Confirmation. h2. Card As an administrator, I want to be able to view and edit content-fields in multiple languages. In a multi-lingual site: changing the culture in the translations drop-down will change the values displayed in the fields corresponding to the selected culture If the Content Field is saved, and no values have been added for the portal default language, then the following actions should occur: If the user chooses to continue editing, the dialog should be closed and nothing should be saved. ** if the user chooses to use the current values as default values, then the values should be save for both the current translation language and for the default language. In a single language site, the Translations label and field should not be displayed. Only the Name, Label and Description values need to be localized. The Data Type list will not be localized. h2. Conversation Should we use a translation service like Google or Bing to auto create the default translation? h2. Confirmation. h2. Card The Dynamic Content Manager currently uses a left hand navigation bar design. This should be changed to use a top tab design as shown in the attached screen shot. h2. Conversation There should be no ""animation"" affect when switching between tabs. CSS should be created using LESS. h2. Confirmation. Regardless, we are completely replacing CRM in DNN 8 with a new version. We are holding off because of the potential risk. As a result, it does not make sense to do an optimization for which will complicate our ability to do the upgrade in DNN 8. This should be held and re-evaluated once the CRM upgrade work is complete.. h2. Card As a developer, I want to be able to use a .SQL extension in addition to the extension for naming platform SQL scripts. h2. Conversation h2. Confirmation. h2. Card As an administrator, I want to be able to re-order content fields. This order is stored and provided to a client module for rendering the ContentItem editor. h2. Conversation h2. Confirmation. Can't change the file name. h2. Card As an administrator, I want to be able to create a new content template. A Template will consist of a name, an associated content type and template file. The editor will use the standard CodeMirror component which is included in the platform. The editor for new Template should be displayed as a new page which animates into view from the left toolbar. The template file field should default to a template folder in the current portal with a file name. When the save button is clicked, the template should be saved and the template record should be save. When the cancel button is clicked, the data is discarded and the editor is closed and the Content Type Edit view for the parent Content Type is displayed. h2. Conversation h2. Confirmation. h2. Card As an administrator, I want to be able to view a list of existing Content Templates. I should also be able to search for Templates based on the Template Name or Type Name. The list should show me the Template names, the template type, which content type the template is associated with and whether the template is a system template. As I move my cursor over a row in the list, I should see icons for the item which allows me to edit or delete a given Template. Above the Template list, there should be a button for creating a new Template. The Template List should show a pager control if the list grows beyond 10 items. All values should be displayed in the current language selected by the user. h2. Conversation h2. Confirmation. h2. Card As an administrator, I want to be able to edit a Data Type. A Data Type will consist of a Type Name, a base type and boolean indicator whether the type is a system type. The editor for the Data Types should be displayed just below the data type in the list. Only Host users should be able to set the system type switch. Once a type is marked as a system type it cannot be reverted back to a non-system type. When the delete button is clicked, it will delete the type from the system, hide the editor and then update the data type list. When the save button is clicked, the record is saved, the editor is hidden and the list is updated to display the new Data Type. When the cancel button is clicked, the data is discarded and the editor is hidden. h2. Conversation h2. Confirmation. h2. Card As an administrator, I want to be able to create a new Data Type. A Data Type will consist of a Type Name, a base type and boolean indicator whether the type is a system type. The editor for new Data Types should be displayed at the top of the data type list, just below the table header. Only Host users should be able to set the system type switch. All Data Types will default to being portal specific types for the portal in which they are created. The delete button should not be visible on the editor. When the save button is clicked, the record is saved, the editor is hidden and the list is updated to display the new Data Type. When the cancel button is clicked, the data is discarded and the editor is hidden. h2. Conversation h2. Confirmation. h2.

This module could be added to any page but should have a page in the admin menu by default. Anyone with View permissions on the module should be able use the module. h2. Confirmation All buttons in the DCC should be rendered as links with appropriate styling to display them as buttons where desired.. DNN upgrades are based on a 3 part version number representing the platform, major and minor version numbers. Each version component uses a 2 digit integer with a leading zero for padding This version number uniquely identifies a release and is used as an identifier when creating database upgrade scripts. Every release may be composed of numerous builds, any one of which might include database changes. All database changes are included in a single script for any given version. This approach to versioning results in difficulty supporting upgrades from Betas to RCs to final release. Also, this script versioning scheme often results in merge conflicts as numerous developers need to edit a common script file. These merge conflicts complicate accepting community pull requests and in rolling back changes when necessary. h2. Card As a developer I want to create a uniquely named database script file for every Pull Request. The system should automatically apply scripts based on the version number and order number specified in the script name. Scripts should follow the following naming convention: where the token uses the standard DNN version number and the token is a simple integer with no padding characters h2. Conversation The system should assume that a script without the order token is applied before any scripts with an order number. It is the code committers responsibility to ensure that scripts are uniquely numbered when checking in scripts. h2. Confirmation.

Card As a developer, I want to create a Settings view for my SPA module. The Settings view should be displayed as a tab on the module settings page and should otherwise operate exactly like the settings page for Web Forms based modules. h2. Conversation h2. Confirmation We should use the method defined in Quick Settings to inject the settings view.. h2. Card As a developer, I want to create a Settings view for my MVC module. The Settings view should be displayed as a tab on the module settings page and should otherwise operate exactly like the settings page for Web Forms based modules. h2. Conversation h2. Confirmation. h2. Card As a developer, I want to be able to use Anti-forgery tokens with my SPA module. An token should be created which developers can include in their HTML. The token should be The developer should be able to decorate their web service methods with the appropriate attribute and have it correctly validate the token generated in the HTML. h2. Conversation h2. Confirmation. h2. Card As a developer, I want to be able to use Anti-forgery tokens with my MVC module. The HTML helper should be modified to work in the DNN framework. The developer should be able to decorate their action methods with the appropriate attribute and have it correctly validate the token. h2. Conversation There is no requirement to support the obsoleted overloads of the helper or attribute. h2. Confirmation. h2. Card As a developer, I want the content I create using the DCC API to get automatically indexed for later searching. The indexer should only index the actual field values and should not pick up any of the field names. h2. Conversation h2. Confirmation. h2. Card As a developer, I want to call an API to create, read, update and delete content which is of a specific contenttype. I should be able to create an individual content item or multiple content items (a list of content items) associated with a specific module instance. If multiple content items are associated with a specific module, then I should be able to specify an order for the items and to retrieve a subset of items based on a page number and page size. h2. Conversation Using a hidden ""order"" field is sufficient to deal with the ordering requirement. There is no requirement to be able to order records based on arbitrary fields. Content should be stored as a serialized JSON object in the content item store. h2. Confirmation. h2. Card As a developer, I would like to have access to a set of common datatypes with a new DNN installation. Common DataTypes should include: Text Time Boolean File Url Markdown h2. Conversation We may not need RichText or Markdown. We also might not want to breakdown the datetime. h2. Confirmation These types cannot be deleted or updated.. h2. Card As a developer, I want to be able to create, read, update and delete DataTypes to be used with DCC ContentTypes. These DataTypes should not define any presentation logic and instead should strictly identify the type of content to be stored in a single field. h2. Conversation A DataType cannot be deleted if it is used in any existing ContentType. Attempting to call a method which deletes the DataType should result in an error. -A DataType should raise a warning if you attempt to alter the datatype where data has already been stored using the datatype A contentitem has been created that includes the h2. Confirmation A DataType should raise an error if you attempt to alter the datatype where data has already been stored. The API should include a flag which allows you to force the datatype change.. h2. Card As a developer, I want to call an API to allow me to Create, Read, Update or Delete ContentTypes. ContentTypes which are created and managed by the DCC should be differentiated from ContentTypes which were created outside of the DCC. A contenttype is just a collection of contentfields. It does not define anything related to how the content might be presented or where content might be stored. It is purely a container. h2. Conversation It is important for the DCC to not get confused by existing ContentTypes which may not conform to the new DCC system. Are contenttypes defined for a portal or a host? h2. Confirmation ContentTypes are defined per portal.. The allows the developer to define a method which will be called to retrieve a collection of module actions. Additional error handling logic should be added to ensure that null reference exceptions don't occur if the method is not properly defined. If the expected method does not exist, then a should be thrown which includes a message indicating the full type and method name that was not implemented. See line 81 of the for a case where a null reference exception may occur.. h2. Card As part of our move to more web service based development, we would like to open up the ability to call platform services from external systems in a secure manner. The simplest approach is to use an HMAC based signature which can be used for both HTTP and HTTPS connections. A custom authorization attribute should be created which implements the HMAC protocol for authorization. h2. Conversation We will not consider using the same API for both internal and external access. h2. Confirmation. SPIKE - Investigate HMAC based authorization for Web Services. h2. Card DNN currently uses a customized membership implementation to handle managing users and This forms the foundation of our security membership is a roles based security system and requires extra effort to enable the integration of claims based systems like OAuth In DNN next we will be using the Identity framework as the foundation of our application security. Identity is a more modern framework and provides improved extensibility and native support for both claims based and role based authorization. As part of our desire to implement OAuth and HMAC security for web services in DNN we would like to determine the level of effort required to implement identity in the current system. As part of the spike, we would like to determine how invasive the change would be, and how it might impact an OAuth server h2. Conversation What is the expected output? Report documenting the findings. The recommended approach (using identity server h2. Confirmation. Create custom JavaScript HTML tokens. h2. Card HTML does not have a mechanism for easily uting server side logic. As part of the SPA module support HTML modules will include support for using DNN tokens. The use of tokens provides the ability to link standard HTML to server side logic. HTML views need to be able to define the JavaScript which is needed to properly render the HTML. Two New standard tokens should be created which defines the JavaScript needed for a view. These tokens will use a new token pattern: Token Type 1: These tokens will call the standard DnnJSInclude methods with the defined parameters. The propertybag is a standard JSON object and includes parameter names and values which are used to call the appropriate include methods. The order of properties in the propertybag is unimportant and should not impact the ability to bind to the appropriate JSInclude methods. Token Type 2: This token variation will load predefined JavaScript packages which have been installed as JavaScript extensions. This token should just be a call to the call on the JavaScript class with the appropriate parameters. h2. Conversation The JavaScript token should be implemented as a standard DNN token which is usable by any module using the TokenReplace engine. This token should be disabled by default and a module must affirmatively indicate that this replacement should be enabled. h2. Confirmation. SPIKE - Support Master Layouts. SPIKE - Support Action Filters. h2. Card As part of MVC support the solution should support the use of standard Action Filters. This is a spike to determine the level of effort needed to implement this feature. h2. Conversation DNN must support the following Action Filters Action - used to provide custom code before and after the ution of the action Exception - used to provide exception handling within an Action h2. Confirmation. h2. Card MVC Modules should behave the same as any other DNN module when it comes to packaging. An MVC module should be installable using a standard DNN module manifest. Since MVC modules use a controller action as the primary method for rendering content, the manifest should allow the module to define a controller and action to render for specific module controls. The DNN framework should use the defined controller action to render the requested module control following the standard DNN convention. While an MVC module may define a number of module controls, it should also be able to define a controller action to use without using a predefined control. When installed, MVC modules should be installed in the DesktopModules folder using the same conventions as more traditional modules. h2. Conversation Need to define the module control naming convention h2. Confirmation Modules should be created in the subfolder.. h2. Card The MVC framework uses HTML helpers to simplify rendering of common HTML elements. Modules written using the MVC framework should be able to utilize all core HTML helpers including: h3. Form Helpers TextBox() RadioButton() DropDownList() Password() h3. Validation Helpers ActionLink h2. Conversation Should add URL and AJAX helpers h2. Confirmation. h2. Card Currently DNN modules use an IActionable interface to define custom module actions which are rendered in the Module Action Menu. The purpose of the interface is to define a well known method that can be called by the framework to retrieve a collection of actions defined by the module developer. Each controller action may be used to render a view and thus should be able to define a collection of actions which the framework can retrieve and render. h2. Conversation A custom method attribute could be used to identify a method that returns a collection of actions. The method must implement a predefined signature but could be located in any class which is accessible by the core framework. It should not be necessary to define the action items in the same controller as the action which relies on the action collection. h2. Confirmation The two attributes should be: - This attribute is used to identify a type and a method which can be called by the framework to retrieve a collection of ModuleActions. By convention, if the type is not defined, it will assume the method exists in the controller. By convention, if the method is not defined, it will assume a method name which corresponds with the action decorated by the Attribute instance the Edit action method would have a corresponding GetEditActions method).. h2. Card The DNN core platform uses modules as the primary mechanism for adding new functionality that includes both business logic and user interface elements. The current implementation is based on web forms and allows module developers to use web controls or server controls for rendering the UI. The platform should be extended to allow module developers to create modules using the MVC framework. A module should support the use of MVC views using the Razor view engine. h2. Conversation DNN must support the use of C razor views. Support for VB based views is optional. MVC views should have access to intrinsics like the Model and ViewBag objects. MVC views must be rendered inside the content area of the module container without injecting any additional HTML elements beyond what is defined in the container and the view. All module views should inherit from a DNN specific base viewpage and should be able to define the model type as part of the view definition. A sample implementation might look like: DnnViewPage It should also support implicit inheritance and then define a model using the helper. h2. Confirmation. h2. Card The Site Log is used to log system activity. Since it was first introduced, newer and better logging options have been added to the platform. All site log APIs and associated database schema and SPROCs should be removed from the core platform and included in the SiteLog module. h2. Conversation As part of extracting this module, upgrade logic should be added to the platform to remove any scheduled tasks and stored procedures related to this feature. The sitelog module should also be removed from the appropriate extensions tables. The sitelog table will remain to avoid any potential data loss. The Site Log module should be moved to and registered in the Forge. h2. Confirmation There should be no site or host settings referencing SiteLog settings. SiteLog related settings should be deprecated in Portal and Host classes but can be completely removed in cases where the class only exists to support SiteLog. NOTE: This will introduce a known breaking change for anyone who might call the SiteLog APIs. It will also remove a feature that might be in use on some websites.. Add a method to allow to delete (soft) modules. If we are going to include services, then we just include services. I don't like the idea of including a ""web method"" which will soon be obsolete. Instead we should add a web service which would be of more value than a web method.. This module should be moved to a separate github repo in the organization.. h3. CARD As a user, I want to see the getting started content in the same language as my website. h3. CONVERSATION We do not want to maintain multiple versions of the formatted html (having the html doc in multiple languages is not desired). Which culture should be used? h3. CONFIRMATION If the user language is in an unsupported language, then we should fall back to English Localization should use the to be consistent with static localization.. h3. CARD As a user I want to see content that is specific to my DNN product and product version. h3. CONVERSATION h3. CONFIRMATION For any version the framework should request content using the following format: Evoq Content ""DNN PE"" Anticipated server side directory structure. Descriptions: DAM throws an error when enabling group mode Steps: - Install DNN Platform - Create a new page and delete the HTML module - Add a Social Groups module and auto configure it - Create a new group - Add a DAM module for the group - Configure it to run in group mode Expected Outcome: The module must only load the group folder Actual Outcome: There is an error, see screenshot.

Card As a site administrator, I should be able to resend an email with a verification code. h3. Conversation A site administrator should be able to go to the user account page and resend a verification code to the user. * The button for resending the verification email should only be visible if the user account is unauthorized and the Account Registration mode is set to ""Verified"". After upgrading my site to DNN cant Edit HTML Or set page module settings. Full Control - Module (P9). The Subscription and digest notification API should have XML comments for all public methods, classes and enumerations.. Specify Location. h3. Card As a developer, I want to be able to specify where the library is loaded on the page. h3. Conversation h3. Confirmation If the location is not specified, then the library should be loaded at the bottom of the page. The locations where a library can be loaded: FormTop ** FormBottom. View Extension Dependencies. View Dependent Extensions. h3. Card As a super user, I want to be able to uninstall a JavaScript Library extension h3. Conversation h3. Confirmation If a JavaScript extension has other extensions which depend on this particular extension, then it cannot be removed unless a later version of the library is already installed.. We currently have numerous places in our code where we are using a pragma directive to suppress compiler warnings about using obsolete methods. The pragma warnings should be removed and the code changed to use the updated methods. The attached list shows all the existinng directives which should be fixed.. ",108,8730,50357

Notice the UI shows that the (with the original name) has been uploaded The file has been renamed to without user intervention The file must not be renamed Note that a file with a + in the name is valid. SI: User registration fails because of non-existing culture value is passed. The way the tag input works, a new tag can only be entered by clicking in a small area, right of the last entered tag (where the mouse cursor changes to a text input): The full tag input area should be clickable to allow entering new tags..

This is raised even if the file has not been uploaded ok, but the control is asking the user to replace or keep.

To know if a notification should be shown as a task, this SProc has the following logic: - If the notification type has no ModuleId, it should not be shown had to add a list of exceptions to this (white list), in order to resolve SOCIAL-3227 - An additional black list filter is performed to exclude some notification types This same mechanism should probably be extended to use in Content's persona bar sproc), so the white black list of types is not the best option. The enhancement proposal is to add a flag to the table, to specify if the notification should be displayed in the task list: - The logic in SPROC will be simplified - The upgrade should set the default values to this flag for each type. Persona Bar Tasks Add ShowAsTask flag to. When there is a long word in the notification list, the flow of the page breaks.

72,dnn,thecrispy1,"DB: Change Columns from NTEXT to NVARCHAR(MAX). We've made some customizations for a client which we think would be a good fit for inclusion in the core. There's a ""Lock Site"" action added to the control bar, which allows a super-user to turn off modifications to the site (probably for entering some sort of maintenance mode). For our client, the ""good enough"" way this is implemented is to disable the module actions whenever the site is locked (in addition, custom modules are able to access the locked status via a property on and do any additional changes, if desired). Testing Notes: - Test exposed on off button in the control panel - When on, verify that it disables module actions (for any user). BLOCKED - Workflow: Lost Publish button again.. HTML Module - Workflow & Module Settings Bug (Seen in Upgrades). I a bit doubt if this issue could be reproduced directly. There are a bunch of activities I already done, such as: - Load and install Inspire skins - Apply this skin to Host Host Settings - Change it back to default - Apply this skin to Admin Site Settings - See error - Change it back to default. However, when I click out Host File Management page, it shows red in the page, and same in log file. But once refreshed and re-loaded, it back to normal.

Client Resources Version not updated when upgrading packages. We need to abstract the current oAuth work and make it a true DNN extension. This should be a Library project and it should NOT be installed by default. As a result, this also means we need to remove the host setting that it.. Noticed this with build 528, local install, with IE10. (Please also check if it is to do anything with the new editor) Pre-condition: Inline edit is enabled. - Log in as host, edit a page - Add a new HTML module on the page, on the left-top side of the module, click on a ""pencil"" icon to bring up the inline editing menu bar - Input any chars in the content area - Click on Save icon button. Result: The content won't be saved.. Noticed with IE10 with platform build 528, local install. - Log in as Host, edit any page In edit mode, there should be couple module editing and setting icon buttons on the right-top side of the module box. But all showing ""black-color square"" in IE 10. UI UX: Bottom control became invisible if CKEditor dialog window longer then Content Edit window. Step to Reproduce: Login as Host Create a New page Deploy the Banner Module on the Page Expected: It should deploy correctly and without showing error. Actual: Banner Module throw exception after deploy on new page. Remove Getting Started. All versions need to be set to.

New default skin Xcillion. The core has the ability to ute code on all version upgrades in addition to the version specific upgrades. This enhancement will provide the option for IUpgradable on modules to ute code on a new Install and or any upgrade, by adding the ""Install"" and ""Upgrade"". ""Install"" - will ute on any new Install ""Upgrade"" will ute on any all upgrades regardless of whether the current version and the new version are different. As the ""Upgrade"" pseudo-version code will ute on any all upgrades it must be re-entrant. - This impacts any extension installed (not the actual of the platform itself) would want to try installing a module (one that is new, also try an upgrade scenario) to make sure things install without problems (this is the regression aspect, not the actual issue) - Typical users won't notice anything, the change was in the manifest file for developers as well as the installer of the platform (to read the manifest) allows you to specify which business logic to run on install and or upgrade (for the module) - Install the DCC admin module. I noticed this twice so far, but not able to figure out the repro steps yet, most likely it only happens once when first time load up admin File Management. Environment: this is a local clean install of platform. Result: You will see some error on the UI and logs as below: * Refresh the page, you won't be able to see the exception in log, neither the error on UI. h2. Card The What's New module is used to display the change log for DNN releases. The core platform no longer maintains the change long in the What's New module and uses the Getting Started feature instead. The What's New module should be deleted. This module does not have it's own API or database structures so there is no backend to consider. h2. Confirmation In installed site (on the file system), there should be no more folder (this is for both new installs and upgrades). DAM: UNC folder provider - folder remains in DAM after it was deleted in the remote server. Screencast On the page search, Search for something (ex: Products) and hit enter to go to search results page Once you are in search results page with results for ""Products"", using the search bar in search results module search for something else (ex: Pages) Click on a search result for ""Pages"" to go to that page Now Press back button in your browser Should go back to search results for Pages: Goes back to the search results for Products: This needs to account for more than 1 page of results. Meaning, if there are 2 pages of results and the user clicks the next button to go to page 2 we need to add this as a new parameter to the URL and make sure the results view goes to the proper page when loaded. It also needs to apply any type filters that have been clicked added.. Extract Configuration manager into a separate module. Extract Dashboard into a separate module. Extract Console into a separate module. h2. Card The Vendors Module is used for managing vendors and banners within DNN. The vendors and banners modules, APIs and database structures should be removed from the core platform and extracted into a standalone solution consisting of the Vendors module and a Banners module. The Banners module will have a dependency on the Vendors module. The vendors module should create a page on the Admin menu when installed. h2. Conversation This initial conversion effort is only focused on conversion to a module and shall not include conversion to a MVC or SPA module. This module will move to a separate GitHub project in the organization. We can drop stored procedures, but should not remove the tables in the core platform. Install of this module should check to ensure the table is not dropped. h2. Confirmation This module will no longer be installed in new installs and this will also be removed from the Admin and Host menus in upgrade scenarios. This means completion of this task should remove the extension and any pages it automatically created. As part of this, the resulting module should also live in a new github repository here: Note: This is a BREAKING CHANGE. Step to reproduce: -Login as Host -Create a child site -create a new page -click on edit content to add content to new page Expected: User should able to enter the content through html editor. Actual: HTML editor is not working after click on edit content. Please refer to screenshot in attachment. SI: URL Encode Decode issue in. A query string which has an encoded equals sign will be truncated. Example: The section ""%3Dequals"" may or may not get removed from the actual address bar, but the application trying to access it will not get it. Steps to reproduce: 1. Create a new page. 2. Add a Razor Host module to the page. 3. Add the following script content to it: Razor reading query string 4. Test using a query string like 5. Test using a query string like Actual result: both will return ""test"" Expected result: the second one would display ""test equals"" Original Example (provided by community): Encoding the value using and passing the value as query string to another page returns "" on decoding. Steps to reproduce Pass the value as query string to second page. Decode the returned value using * The result is "", "" "" text is missing.. In Platform 8 (and also partially backported to support was added to enable incremental upgrades in a single version for files. This task is to enhance incremental upgrades so incremental cleanup files are also supported. The only way to test this is to have multiple cleanup files for a single version and they would be declared in the manifest (dnn file). If you have 2 dummy text files in a module, let's say and that are installed as part of a module's version (revision 0) the way you would test this is build a new revision of the module (so revision 1) that says delete and or as part of cleanup (this is in the manifest dnn file). If properly declared in the manifest upgrading the existing module to revision 1 should delete those files from the module's folder.. SI: Soft Deleted Modules Show When Adding Existing Modules In Other Portals. EVOQCONTENT - ""Resource cannot be found"" error when trying to Register as a new User and Cancelling. BLOCKED: DB Performance Improvements (Overall Improvements). Page Output caching provider is only available in Commercial products. Lack of this feature slows down sites based on Platform. DNN Corp. has decided to make this feature available to DNN Platform.. Provide Multi-language Support for Adding Editing Content Fields. Regular users shouldn't be allowed to send mass messages to Security roles. This ability should only be limited to Administrators & Super Users.

Icon not reset in Admin - Page management. Upgrade: Fatal error when Log In after EE upgraded to. Upgrade: Cannot access site with Runtime Error during upgrade. Installation progress UI stopped at 29%. SI: Request Filter not uting. h2. Card The Site Log is used to log system activity. Since it was first introduced, newer and better logging options have been added to the platform. All site log APIs and associated database schema and SPROCs should be removed from the core platform and included in the SiteLog module. h2. Conversation As part of extracting this module, upgrade logic should be added to the platform to remove any scheduled tasks and stored procedures related to this feature. The sitelog module should also be removed from the appropriate extensions tables. The sitelog table will remain to avoid any potential data loss. The Site Log module should be moved to and registered in the Forge. h2. Confirmation There should be no site or host settings referencing SiteLog settings. SiteLog related settings should be deprecated in Portal and Host classes but can be completely removed in cases where the class only exists to support SiteLog. New installs and upgrades alike should not have this module (under extensions) or the Admin pages available post Also, as part of this the extracted module should live in a new github repository here: NOTE: This will introduce a known breaking change for anyone who might call the SiteLog APIs. It will also remove a feature that might be in use on some websites.. SI: Culture Neutral Page don't show up as a menu sub item when not in the site default language (en-US). Cloud - iUpgradable problem causes content in various modules to not work. The default website template in both the Content and Enterprise packages are using the identical template (different sources) which includes the xml node for 2 pages in the template (the home page and the Our Products page). This, however, is not being picked up by the site creation as part of the import process. The end result is we ended up w multiple module instances and a layout that is stacked (instead of side by side within Content Layout). EVOQSOCIAL - UX enhancements. EVOQSOCIAL: Error in logfile: A potentially dangerous value was detected from the client. This module should be moved to a separate github repo in the organization. This will impact both installs and upgrades. It also means that the newsletter module page under admin will be removed in both scenarios.. EVOQSOCIAL: Get search modules is called needlessly multiple times. Page Creation renders a .JS error. EVOQSOCIAL: Duplicated area of search results. This is how the upload file currently looks (for example, when uploading a new profile picture): The user has to click on the text ""Click to Browse"" to bring up the file LIBRARY mockup as well). EVOQSOCIAL: Update DAM Upload Dialog Styling. EVOQSOCIAL: Forcing a password reset still makes the user go to their email and click on the link. Subscription sub description is not localized. - Add Events in Platform (for Mechanics). This is about adding events to the Platform so that listeners can know when multiple items occur so we can then hook into mechanics and log activity when this happens (similar to what we do w Users today and portals). We need to ensure there are additional events for the following (most are for Content): - Relationship Formed (added a someone) - Relationship Dissolved (removed a friend stopped following) - Folder Created (DAM Should have this today) - Folder Deleted (DAM Should have this today) - Folder Updated (DAM Should have this today) - File Created (DAM Should have this today) - File Deleted (DAM Should have this today) - File Updated (DAM Should have this today) - Page Tab Created - Page Tab Deleted - Page Tab Updated - Module Created - Module Deleted - Module Updated. SI: Relationship Scoring Actions. Currently, the Sproc gets the list of task from the user notifications. To know if a notification should be shown as a task, this Sproc has the following logic: - If the notification type has no ModuleId, it should not be shown had to add a list of exceptions to this (white list), in order to resolve SOCIAL-3227 - An additional black list filter is performed to exclude some notification types This same mechanism should be extended to use in Content's persona bar sproc), so the white black list of types is not the best option. The enhancement proposal is to add a flag to the table, to specify if the notification should be displayed in the task list: - The logic in SPROC will be simplified - The default value should be false (each notification type needs to be updated in Content Social to set this to true; taking into consideration upgrades vs. new installations) - This column, IsTask, should be created via the Platform as a bit column and have all values set to 0 (false) then add a constraint for NOT NULL. - The API that exists today (for creating notification types) should create an overload method passing a default value of 0 (and also mark existing method as obsolete; only required if the method today is parameterized) Note: The solution here must work for both Content & Social.. EVOQSOCIAL - Persona Bar Tasks Add IsTask flag to. Profanity breaks Idea creation in Social. I was trying to create an Idea in social cloud, but right after Vince update the Profanity words and turned it on, suddenly the new creation of idea all failed. Error message like: parsing - Nested quantifier *. Attached with Profanity Words Vince used.. IE stopped working if type Enter key in Journal. EVOQSOCIAL - SI: Member Directory group mode bug. Notifications Stream doesn't resize images. SI: DAM URL Upload Error. SI: Taxonomy control clears selection on postback. SI: Group Module does not show Groups for.

Not happen in and fine with FF & Chrome Steps: - log in as host - goto Admin Taxonomy - Click ""Create New Vocabulary"", input anything required. - Click ""Create Vocabulary"" Result: with PE & EE, the creation pop-up window keeps loading, looks like never complete, the window won't be closed. - Close the pop-up window by clicking ""X"" button Actually the new vocabulary is created.. Admin LIsts - In Chrome 404's are thrown on jQuery load. Ingore words fails if word is mixed case. Journal should convert urls to hyperlinks. add code to the installer to verify the new minimum prerequisites. I was under the impression that we already had this code - so we need to verify if it is there, and if so working - and if it's not there, add it. Verify: - SQL 2008 - .NET (Verify exact version) - IIS?. EVOQSOCIAL: User Search - Include Email and Username while Indexing. SI: Custom Profile Field Validation option broken when using Date Regx. SI: Extend SearchDocument class with DocumentIcon. SI: Display Name should be updated accordingly when user profile changed. Pre-Condition: - Go to Site Settings User Account Settings and define a display name format as - Create a New User by using this new setting Steps: - Log in as Host, goto User Manage Users - Click a Pencil icon button to edit the new created user account - Click Manage Profile tab - Change First Name and Last Name, and update it - Go back to Manage Account tab Result: FirstName & LastName in Manage Account Tab are updated, but display name didn't get updated accordingly. Expected: It shall trigger to update the Display Name as well.. Scheduler throws error from. There was a change in behavior between and that has resulted in cache files being included in the template when 'include files' is checked. The files included are the .resources ones in the cache folder and I am attaching templates generated in Social in and to verify an example. (Open these w a text editor, search for .resources, you will find them only in Expected: No cache .resources files exported as part of template. To reproduce: - As host, go to Host - Site Management and click ""Export Site"" - Add a name and description for the template (pick a site) - Scroll down and in the advanced area check ""Include Files"", leaving rest default - View exported site template with text editor, search for .resources. SI: Globally Disable Private messaging. Iconbar files are still included with DNN but it is not provided as ControlPanel option in Host Settings. Remove files from distribution (including resource file, please).. Under Admin - Site Settings and within the Advanced Settings tab, there is a Messaging section. In here, administrators can control the maximum recipient count for any peer to peer messaging (to avoid spamming). This limitiation, however, should not apply to notifications (which Subscriptions in now depend on). Notifications should be unlimited here, but as of this was not the case. To reproduce it you need something with at least 6 subscribers (use Answers in Social subscribe module wide with 6 users then try to ask a question w a 7th user). This was reported by a customer in Social and we were able to resolve it by increasing the limit set here (it also impacted all other Social modules w subscriptions and will impact platform in. Notifications: Notifications shouldn't go across Portal Profanity Filter. Steps to reproduce: 1) Create a blog post 2) try to comment on that blog post with a comment longer than 2000 words. Actual Result: There is no setting to set the word count for comments, and currently comments will be truncated at 2000 words, despite being able to type over 2000 words in the comment text box. Expected Result: There should be an option to post unlimited word comments Regression Notes: Changes here have the potential to impact Likes on comments (only). Therefore, Likes on commenting need to be regressed (the Activity Stream should suffice). Although Activity Stream should suffice for verification, we should also verify Journal (likes and commenting).. Update Site Template to Use Copies of Console Modules on user Profile Pages. The Console module should use a copy on all pages (except the main Activity Stream one) so it is easier to change settings across multiple instances. Note: We will not handle upgrade scenarios for this because it is too invasive. Testing Notes: - Login as an admin or super user. - Go to your profile page (the one w the Activity Stream journal on it) - Edit the module settings for the console module, change it to show small icons - Go to any other page shown there (friends, messages, my profile) and verify it shows the icon on all those pages.

Card As a developer, I want the content I create using the DCC API to get automatically indexed for later searching. The indexer should only index the actual field values and should not pick up any of the field names. Given values are all stored in Json format, it is not easy to sort filter paginate through database calls. For example, we have a content type: Employee and we want to sort on First Name. The current APIs won't be able to do that as values are stored in Json. We are going to use Search APIs to perform sort filter pagination based on data in Lucene. This requires that we provide the correct names for the various fields in Search. h2. Conversation h2. Confirmation. EVOQCONTENT: Installation progress UI stopped at 29%. EVOQCONTENT: Uploading ANY file through Database Folder Provider fails. EVOQSOCIAL: Cloud - iUpgradable problem causes content in various modules to not work. EVOQCONTENT: Introduce ContentItem for Folders. In a previous release we introduced ContentItemId integration with Files in DNN. We need to same thing for Folders.

EVOQSOCIAL: Private Registration: Notification does not allow CM Moderators to the user. Currently the UserSearch in DNN does not index Username or Email address. We should capture that so they can be searched upon. They should both by default be restricted to Admins or the Users him her self only. We should also try to enhance the current logic where everything is being dumped in instead we should use custom keywords so at the time of querying structured data can be retrieved. There are few dates that can also be added in the SearchDocument Date User was created). This information can be used when someone uses the SearchAPIs to perform custom queries and sorting..

We have number of parameters in both the SearchDocument and SearchQuery objects (such as ModuleId, ModuleDefId, TabId, However, we don't have GroupId. In a environment, modules usually have just one instance of themselve, but the data has additional property of GroupId to segmenet them from one group to the other. Usually groupId is upplied via query string parameter. Lack of groupid in these objects causes items to be searchable from all the groups. Note: The groupid should be saved or searched only when it's 0 (have a look at code around in method) Unit tests must be written (copy paste change from others). The Console module should use a copy on all pages (except the main Activity Stream one) so it is easier to change settings across multiple instances.

Meanwhile as Host Admin user, the EditMode always displays ""True"". EditMode more like: Editable. I was using local installed Content with Chrome Pre-Condition: In host Host Settings Advanced Settings Client Resource Management, turn on ""Enable Composite Files"", ""Minify CSS"" and ""Minify JS"". Update the settings and then also click on ""Increment Version"". Steps: - Goto to home page, and edit this page. - Click in to any one of HTML editor and bring up the ""Advanced Editor"". Result: The UI already messed up If you click on ""Basic Text Box"" (looks ok), and click back on ""Rich Text Editor"", you will see the page keeps loading without display properly.

Set up the start time and end time for this page. (need to make it expired) Register a new user: RU1 and put it in ""Translator"" role. Assign the new page ""Test"" to allow ""Translator"" to edit and add content. Create a Personalized Page, and add a rule for user ""Translator"" and publish it. Log out host and log in as RU1, before the page expired, and the page shall be visible for Ru1 and editable. Wait till the page expired, and visit the page again. Result: The page still editable, but display: You do not have access to view this page within the website. Expected: For any user has edit permission on the master page, the page shall always visible and editable even it is expired.. Expired master page shall be still visible to users who have edit permissions. ( ) Validate on latest platform build 790, it works fine now. (x) Upgraded from previous failed build and works fine.

But it works fine with local install.

(not happen always). Create Child portal on Azurewebsite failed (UI response failed). Probably already fixed.. It happens on windows Azure websites Didn't see Platform & Content. Looks like it is progress UI issue. Site is installed and launchable. Pre-condition: - all credential required for (ask Bing or QA if you don't have one) - Create a new site & DB for installation testing General Steps: - Start installation process by wizard - Provide proper DB connection & user account which is set up in - Continue the installation to observe the progress bar Result: It stops 29% Installing Library - Check the Installation log file, no detected, and the last line in log is: Activating License So the site actually installed, but because of some response time-out reason (I guess), the progress UI got frozen. Expected: The installation progress bar shall re-try always to pick-up the status.. Unauthenticated Cacheability is by default set to expected? Please be aware, we changed default settings or customer's settings.. Exceptions displayed when Cancel a Language Pack installation. Some 3rd-party skins installation failed if upgraded from finally cause browser crash..

The symptom is, after pick up the skin zip file, and click ""Go Next"", the user will see a blank 500 error page. Screenshot attached. Or error like this: I was using IE 11, and when I try to do the same installation again, the IE browser crashed.. Perform an upgrading test and validate if the module versions updated accordingly.. Validated with Engage build I can see the still in the css file after Enable Composite Files and Minify CSS, inline images displayed properly. Close as it is.. With new UI design and new format in Platform home page, I don't think the behavior still the same as Content (the old UI) Preconditions: - Login as a host; - Create a new Page; - On Control Panel click on Modules Add Existing Module option; - Select a Home Page (the new UI) - Tick Make a Copy checkbox; - Select HTML module one by one and Drag & Drop a Module to Content Pane. Result: The contents of the html module are all there, but obviously the style sheet or the template is different. Comparing to the same test against PE with old UI, and make a copy of the existing HTML module on home page, the images size, position, URL link, font & font size, all the same. Is this behavior in Platform (with new Home page) expected? Or the new Home page is a special case? It might be only related to the new Home page, but I can't continue with more investigation, since it is blocked by another defect: DNN-5406. Not repro in neither from control menu Pages add new page Steps: - Log in as Admin or Host - On Control Panel click Admin option; - Select Page Management option; - Hover over My Website folder, right-click on it. - Click on Add Page button to open corresponding input; - Fill required info; - Click on Create Page(s) button. Result: There would be couple (6) Fatal error msgs in log file: - (0x80004005): This is an invalid webresource request. at context) step, Boolean& Not sure about this error about, and I can still continue to create a page, just quite noisy and would like to know the root cause.. - Log in as host - Add a new page ""testpage"" - Goto Modules Add New Module to bring up the module control panel - In input area, input character ""d"" - then Drag one of the module and swipe to very left and very right for couple times - Try to use scroll bar to the very right-end, and pick up one module at the end of the list. Result: see attachment. Some modules will still in the hidden (invisible) area of the module list, and won't be able to be picked. The scroll-bar calculation somehow goes wrong. I also randomly encountered situation, the drag ans swipe stop working as well with IE 11.. Noticed this in Cloud environment, but I believe It is a regression since it doesn't happen in and probably brought in by Control Bar Add Module Scrolling (CONTENT-2319) or module filtering changes. Steps: - Log in as host - Goto any page - Click Modules Add New Module - In the Module filtering list box, click the Drop-down arrow icon button. Result: It won't work. But it works in But if click on the list box, it still fine.. Be careful about GetUserById. I remember something changed in this sprint.. Noticed this in custom CE build - Log in as Host, create a new page - Goto Edit Page Page Permissions - Preset permission for All Users to View Pages.

78,dnn,dukesb11,"DNN should support JS library packages without their own script, but which just pull in dependencies. This mostly works already, but causes a tag to be included for the empty library, causing a 404 request. h3. Steps to Reproduce Download all packages from which have a numeric prefix Copy those packages to the folder of your DNN website Hit the URL of your DNN website Ensure script combination is turned off Install attached module which requests the JS library h3. Expected Results No script requests that result in a 404 h3. Actual Results * Request for the library folder ), which results in a 404.

Expected Result: The link text box is pre-populated with "" Side note: for some reason I thought it would be a good idea to create this issue as a clone of DNN-3543, and now I see that it copied some info that it shouldn't and that I can't remove (specifically the Sprint, but probably other stuff, too). Sorry.. If the manifest for an extension has a comment in a component, the installer throws an exception: A critical error has occurred. The method is not supported on node type Comment. Line 26, position 7.. The code looks like this: So, it does . But, the webresource urls are encoded and case sensitivity seems to matter. As a result, using results in a URL that's broken when it's added to the page using the function. This is breaking code in some custom modules that need to load JS files.. It'd be wonderful to be able to have a way to mock calls to and other methods on the class.. When a container, such as the default Pop-Up Container, uses controls, errors that occur early in the module's lifetime will cause the to not get setup completely, and throw errors. This means that when errors occur in the module, the users sees an error message that doesn't have anything to do with the real error. In the same way, when they look in the Event Viewer, they need to know to ignore the most recent error, and look at the first error that occurred in the group of errors. h3. Steps to Reproduce Install attached package with example module and container Put module on a page Change its container in module settings to Host: TooManyErrors - Click the See an error! button h3. Expected Results - See real error: ""Unable to cast object of type to type - In the Event Viewer, only errors with that error message are logged h3. Actual Results - See unrelated error: ""Object reference not set to an instance of an - In the Event Viewer, the real error and the unrelated error are all shown The forthcoming pull request has the action controls short-circuit their operation if they detect that they aren't setup correctly, instead of getting to their null reference. This fixes the extraneous null reference errors. The real error still gets logged three different times, which may be a separate issue to look at; however, wherever you look, you see a meaningful error, so I think it's a clear improvement..

80,dnn,francesco.rivola,"The IPCount mechanism to prevent DoS attack write files under AppData. In regression we have found some locking issues and this locking can be more aggressive in web farm scenario (see related issue DNN-8086). The goal of this improvement is change the mechanism to use memory cache) or database to provide a more roboust solution. Caching should be the first option as we want have a very high performance mechanism. Database would imply a considerable number of read writes that could hit performance. In that case we should ensure that the solution does not impact the site overall performance. If we use a system based on cache we should consider web farm scenario.. With the new in place we decided to remove from the platform the code of the old user profile picture handler:. Noticed with build 599 local install. It happens to both install and uninstall. The module needs to be manually installed with build 599, it is located Host Extensions Available Extensions Provider. CKEditor should not be set as default Html Provider on Upgrades.

Confirmation Note for DEV: please ensure that we remove anything related to that feature and we do not leave any dead code in the source.. Remove Advanced Settings. h2. Card One DNN 7 ""feature"" that I think needs to be added to items for DNN 8 cleanup is the removal of the Advanced Settings screen. This page was created to ""simplify"" settings by aggregating many common settings into one location. What this ultimately did was complicate things by giving people multiple locations for accomplishing the same task. It didn't remove options, but instead duplicated options that were already available. h2. Conversation Often the way this was implemented was by re-using existing user controls in the new Advanced Settings screen. This approach is blocking the team's ability to separate out the Skins module since one of the user controls in the skins module is also used in the advanced settings page. See DNN-6637. h2. Confirmation The Advanced Configuration Setting page and module should be uninstalled and removed in upgrade and new install of platform Note for DEV: please ensure that we remove anything related to that feature and we do not leave any dead code in the source. Keep in mind that probably all the user control used by this module does not belong to him as are from other module. In this case we cannot cleanup these files as part of this story.. The current format of the Content Item is in json and for a type like Product (see below): Product Description (string) Picture (integer) Is in the following format: This format is currently over complex the structure of the json and could be simplified with a more natural and intuitive format (similar of what MongoDB use as well): The proposed format: save spaces in the database it is easier to read Note: the content type Id is also probably no required as this information is already stored in the Content Item table: Note for DEV: we should carefully review if this new proposed format fits with any needs of the DCC: Lists *. DCC API - Simplify Dynamic Content Item json format. In the current implementation any content template file is a file stored inside Portals X folder (where X is default for global templates or the ID of the portal for local templates). This space is managed by the DNN Folder Provider system. This means that depending on the configuration of the folder the templates could be locally in the server file system (standard folder provider), in the database (database folder provider) or even in remote location Azure, Amazon, DropBox folder provider, see Cloud configuration that by default use Azure folder provider). The current implementation always assumes that these files are stored locally. See method in the class This latter assumption seems related to how the current DCC Module MVC implementation works that need to be able to reach the template file physically in the file system: We probably need to discuss more this part. Having the template under the Folder Provider could expose several issues: Admin Content Manager from DAM or Assets could delete those files causing inconsistency unwished issues in the DCC system We could consider store the templates files under Benefits: We always ensure that the files are locally stored and accessible via the Server File System : Admin couldnt edit replace these file from DAM. Currently all the logic to delete or add a template is in the Web Methods of the DCC Admin Module. See Delete Template Save Template Note: Similar code is duplicated in the Business Controller of the Admin module to create the default templates. We should move this code down into the API level class) as this is something that the API should be able to manage, so third party or other component do not need to care about templates files logic and any operation using the API is atomic and consistent. As part of this task we will need to write: * Unit and if needed and possible Integration Tests. Quick Settings Implement as a JQuery plugin. DCC - Error creating new content field with invalid field type.. The goal of this task is perform an architectural review of DCC Architecture. : Ensure proper indexes are in place Ensure system will not create overly large tables, thus requiring lots of disk space Queries are efficient and combined together : We have decent caching so that we are not hitting database for every page load (anonymous and registered users both) Ensure client side JS is optimal.

EVOQCONTENT - Sync Knockout javascript library version stored under. In Platform tab workflow was implemented and the AddTab method was changed to start workflow (if workflow was enabled) on page creation. We have detected issues with this approach as the page version is created only when you have modules on the page. So we can have scenario where you try to complete a tab workflow with no pending to be published version. This scenario was already handled in Evoq but making things complex. It was a workaround instead the right solution. The goal of the task is remove the code that start the workflow on tab creation. And let that the workflow mechanism is fired by the page change tracking system (add, move, delete modules, : this change does not impact Platform behavior as tab workflow is not enabled.. EVOQCONTENT - Do not start Workflow in AddTab Method. Module Actions - add support to identify in the DOM the module actions menu items. In Platform the module actions in Edit Mode are generated as a list.

EVOQCONTENT - Page Versions Rollback can be done in the backend for the last page version. Add a service to that allows to delete (soft) a module included in one tab. Note: this web method should be only available to Admin Host and created for integration testing purposes.. EVOQCONTENT - Add a method to allow to delete (soft) modules. With this improvent we will be able to create and manage System Tabs. A System Tab could be considered as a special tab, created by solution purposes, different fron tabs created by users. As these tabs may have a specific functionality, we should add some restrictions on the solution ir order to not break that functionality or not create corrupted data. TabController should manage System Tabs as they are other normal tabs Tab will be just a new field in the TabInfo entity we need to ensure that some existing features doesn't manage System Tabs, as following: - Export Site: System Tabs are specific for a portal and installation, therefore they should not be exported - Sitemap: System Tabs are not pages created by users, they should not be part of the explicit navigation, therefore they should not appear in the Sitemap - Content Localization: System Tabs are not pages created by users, they should not be localized - Page Picker: System tabs should not visible.

Currently some of the web methods return a 200 http response with an empty body on success. This has issue when jQuery ajax calls are performed with as the empty response is handled as an error (empty response is an invalid json). The will fix this changing the empty success response with. The utils class works with private STATIC imgWidth and imgHeight members. These two fields should be removed and created as method variables. Statics members have issues in concurrency scenario. The profile picture thumbnails are created when requested if they have not been generated previously or if they have been removed (see for further details). If the user loads a page with a lot of user profile pictures of the same user Journal in the Profile Page) we can run into concurrency issues and the images can be created with an incorrect width or height..

Card As a DCC Viewer Editor, I want to be able to add content to items of type list and be able to see them. h2. Conversation This can be achieved by implementing the appropiate EditorFor methods in the class and the DisplayFor methods in the class for supporting fields of types list. This implementation will create html and javascript code to elements to the list. It mught be necessary to implement LabelFor methods in the class. DCC - Cannot add translations for a content field when creating a new one.. When different languages are enabled on a portal the name, label and description of a content field can be localized. However, at the moment of creating a new one the UI allows the user to enter the translations for each language but they are not stored at all (only the name, label and description of the language of the portal). The user can only add the translations at the moment of editing an existing content field. - Login as a superuser - Enable a second language in the site (Go to - Go to Admin - Dynamic content type manager - Edit a Content type (for example Employee) - Click on ""Add Field"" button - Enter a name, label and description a ""Language"" combobox - Enter a translation for the name, label and description - Click on ""Save"" button - The translation for the name of the content field can be seen on the grid - The name cell for the created field on the grid is empty, because the translation was not stored.. DCC - Quick Settings Implement as a JQuery plugin. Error creating new content field with invalid field type.. When a user adds a new data field to a content type, by default the selected field type is the text ""Content types"", which is not a real field type but a UI separator. It is possible to go ahead and create the data field but with an incorrect field type (there is no validation in the server side). Accessing again to the content type causes Http 500 errors. Please watch: - Log in as host - Edit a content type - Press the Add field button - Enter a name, label and description for the data field (leave field type as it is) - Press save - Reload the DCC-Manager again - Edit again the same content type - The content type information and its data fields are loaded and shown in the UI - The inputs are empty an a HTTP 500 error is logged in the browser console Not only we should not allowed invalid data fields: a server side validation for the content field data should be implemented and the errors coming it should be shown in the UI nicely (on a modal popup window, as in other parts of the DCC - Admin). I can't create fields with duplicated name, but I can modify the fields to have same name after created. Steps: - Log in as host and in DCC Manager create a new Content Type: BingType1 - Create 2 fields with different name - Modify one of the fields to have the same Name and Label with the another one. Result: It is allowed to change with same Name and Label. Expected: Should always check for Name Label's duplication.. Cannot find a superuser by email.. If we make a call to the method in the class we get a List of objects, which indicates us the roles that a specificar users has. However, the property is not filled with the actual value it has in database. Thus, it always has value. Assign a SystemRole to the Actual result All the returned UserRoleInfo objects have IsSystemRole false IsSystemRole true* The underlying stored procedure used is GetUserRoles, which makes a query on the view vw UserRoles. Adding the IsSystemRole field in table Roles to the view should fix the bug.. ""Resource cannot be found"" error when trying to Register as a new User and Cancelling. Host & Admin pages cannot be set to open link in a new window. When a user sets a host page or an admin page to be a link to other url and enables the option ""Open Link In New Browser Window"" it does not work: the link is always opened in the same browser window and the check is disabled again in the UI (although the associated TabSetting is updated in database). This last point only happens for Host pages. - Login as host - Go to Admin - Page Management - Check Manage ""Host Pages"" - Select any host page, ""Extensions"" - Click on the Link section - Select the option Link- Url - Enter a url. - Check the option ""Open Link In New Browser Window"" - Click on the Update button (Please note that the option checked in the previous step is unchecked again, which is unexpected) - Clear Cache.

In the case of Admin Pages the check remains checked but the url is not opened in a new browser window neither.. With Platform it was introduced a new caching layer in the Now when we get the PortalSettings we follow this order: Search at the HttpContext of the HttpRequest Search at the DataCache Search at the DataBase If the PortalSettings is retrieved in any of these steps we don't continue searching. However, when we update any PortalSetting and we explicitly clear the DataCache associated with that PortalSetting the previously existing PortalSettings in the HttpContext are not updated. This can cause incoherences within the same HttpRequest: a piece of code can update a portal setting with the option to clear the data cache and if afterwards it tries to get the stored value it would get the old value again. The fix should be the following: after updating a portal setting and clearing data cache the value in the HttpContext should be updated according to the new value.. EVOQSOCIAL - PortalSettings incoherence after update in the same Request. The class (in namespace) already has the method . It allows to search for all the Content Items that have the specified term. In some scenarios, it could be useful to make a search for a term only for the Content Items of a single Portal. This issue is about creating a new method with the following signature: It will perform the same search as the other method but restricted to only the ContentItems of a Tab that belongs to the portal with the provided id.. When a host user tries to add a New Page a javascript error is thrown and the action cannot be done. - Log in as host - Go to Users - Manage Users - Without changing the page, click on Pages - Add new Page - Enter the page Name, Title and Url test) - Select the ""Add to the End"" option in ""Insert Page"" - In Parent Page, select the option - Click on the ""Add Page"" button - The new page is created and added to the end of the root pages list - The browser is redirected to the new page. - The page is not created and a javascript error is logged on the console. When a users access to the search page passing a specific tag by the query string the page shows the same results twice. - Log in as Host - Create a new question with the word and the tag - Run the task ""Search - Site crawler"" in Schedule to index the content - Access to the url of searching passing by parameter the tag . You can use a url as this one: Expected result Actual result* - the page shows the question twice. Notice that the second results are inside a grid that had never been shown before.. Sometimes the log files shows the following error message: - (0x80004005): A potentially dangerous value was detected from the client ( : ). context) The url is the one that makes this error to happen, as you can see in the screenshot: Typically that error only occurs if a website is using in it's - we ship with which means that paths that contain colons don't cause the issue. The link is in that form to ensure that after a user registers (as register is a virtual page), they return to the correct portal - we could add code to detect if a single portal is installed and simply render it as a register.. When SOCIAL is installed in a virtual directory in IIS and a child portal is created, the registered users can't log in the child portal. - Install social in a virtual directory. - Login as host - Add to the list of site aliases in Admin- Site Settings- Site Aliases - Create a child portal with name ""child1"" - if it is not set, add to the list of site aliases in Admin- Site Settings- Site Aliases in the child site - Create a registered user in the child portal - Log out - Try to log in the child portal as the registered user created before - Page is reloaded but the user is not logged in. - The user should be logged in the child site. EVOQSOCIAL: Duplicated search results. The task Search: Site crawler performs the indexing of the content of the site. This process consists in the following steps: 1. Get all the that has not been indexed since last ution. A SearchDocument is each piece of content in DNN. 2. Delete the previous existing stored indexed version of each document (if it exists). 3. Index and store all the of 1. The step 2 is done by comparing some fields of the stored search documents with the fields of the new search document. The problem is that in this comparison the fields ""Keywords"" and the fields ""NumericKeys"" are used to compare. This is not correct, because they may change for the same document. Imagine this situation: - A content is added to the site and it is indexed - Afterwards, this content is edited and a new keywork is added to it - The indexing is run again and it detects that it is a new document (has a different keyword of the already indexed one) - A user performs a search using a word of the body of the content and he she gets 2 results, each one for the same content..

So if there are more files after this missing sequence number, they won't be uted. Currently this kind of problems is happening on the cleanup and configuration folders. This behaviour implies that a new issue has to add a new incremental configuration, it will have to used the first missing sequence number in order to be uted.

Steps to Reproduce create connections, shut down the program, restart and connections are gone. h3. Actual Result no connection info h3. Expected Result expect to not have to recreate connection info for all sites everytime the program is started. When launching Studio on a fresh Linux install, the Dashboard fails to load and Studio prompts to close. Screenshots attached. Log attached. This is not a regression. Steps to Reproduce: 1. Clean install Ubuntu. 2. Install JDK using the linux install manager. 3. Install Titanium Studio. 4. Launch Titanium Studio. Actual Result: Dashboard fails to load, error pop-up, second error prompting user to close Studio. Expected Result: No errors, dashboard should load.. Linux: Direct users to workaround if dashboard fails to load on fresh install. Lion: High CPU Usage. Show char limit in the git commit message field. It would be nice if aptana would show me when a line in the commit message field is longer than 50 chars so i know when I have to do an linebreak. Because normaly git commit messages should be never have longer lines than 50 chars. From here ( the suggestion is 50 chars is a good length. We could show a grey line in the text field, much like is done in the regular editor. We should also have a command-line option to change the value.. Remote View: Refresh required to see FTP connections after startup. XHTML: Invalid ' isn't allowed after elements' warning. Inside Aptana Studio, check out and import Ruble project Open and note the invalid warning in the gutter on the node This is valid syntax for XHTML.. XHTML: Invalid warning on ""html proprietary attribute. h3. Steps to Reproduce Create a new workspace Navigate to YAML settings Change to 4 spaces Click ""Apply"", then ""Ok"" Close Preferences, then reopen Note YAML value is back at 2 h3. Actual Result Indentation is only 2 h3. Expected Result Indentation should be 4. Create Jenkins build. This makes the latest version of Rubles available to all Studio users. This runs two git commands as part of the build script: .ruble projects from the master to the stable branch * Push the results back to Github. Git tag Aptana Studio builds on push to stable. Related to APSTUD-7238. As part of that build, (before the push): See if that git tag has not already been created. If not, create a new tag of the form (note the additional ""v"" at the front) studio3 studio3-php Pydev swt-webkit .ruble. Found in the log file (attached):. Cache for improved editor colorization performance. JavaScript: Formatter adds space at 'for' loops. Summary log from chat recorded on poker session Story Time 20120731: Ingo Muschenetz: dunno why I can't connect again. Trying. Function outline not linking line numbers properly. h3. Steps to Reproduce Open Aptana 3 Submit bug report Click returned link h3. Actual Result Safari opens h3. Expected Result Default browser (Chrome in this case) opens. PHP: Error formatting classes with numeric index. Formatting the following PHP code gives the error ""Unable to format. See error log for to comment out or remove the ""if"", the problem disappears.. At the moment, we only have DOM reference docs for HTML in the Studio's internal help pages. We need proper HTML help docs that provides better explanations and samples. Tasks: See See (currently commented out). Port the interactive console in PyDev to Javascript. Created branch in PyDev: to handle that. Notes: Rhino eval loop: Javascript XML-RPC library: Must check how to get in that environment Add documentation on how to use the console. At the moment, we only have a few DOM reference elements for CSS in the Studio's internal help pages. We need CSS help docs that provides better explanations and samples. Tasks: See See (currently commented out). If you add an PHP interpreter and add the default file you get the error message that Aptana can't save the file This is true because if you install php via the the repositories the normal Aptana user never has write access to that file. This save check should be optional.. h3. Steps to Reproduce When this textarea (Steps to Reproduce) gets filled too far (vertically or horizontally), there are no scrollbars to let the user know he can scroll the text. h3. Actual Result No scrollbars h3. Expected Result Scrollbars. Assertion Failed in. Aptana crashed when coding (some PDO function) and cannot open the file anymore with the following error:. PHPDoc block is not applied to the vars in the function itself. Aptana is not showing the documentation for the vars which are the parameters to the function. Please see the screenshot for a better description.. Autocomplete in html tag attributes eats up following attributes. h3. Steps to Reproduce 1. In a HTML document insert """" 2. Now place the cursor right before ""preload"" and start typing ""autoplay "" 3. When Aptana suggests the two values ""true"" and ""false"" select one and hit TAB or ENTER h3. Actual Result h3. Expected Result. h3. Steps to Reproduce Try to right click on publish function or click on publish button but this no work h3. Actual Result The publish button no work in aptana plug in for eclipse h3. Expected Result publish button upload, download and deployment settings. Publish button greyed out in Eclipse plugin version on Eclipse. SWTException: Widget is disposed in. Sorting files in the ""Files Transfer View"" doesn't work. h3. Steps to Reproduce In ""remote"" right click ""transfer files"". In the file listing that shows up, click ""last modified"" or ""size"". You would expect a sorting of file list by size or date. But this doesn't happen. Would be very nice if it works to show last edited files on top. h3. Actual Result none h3. Expected Result sort filelist by date (or size). The problem appears when working with javascript files (I'm manipulating a small library) and prototype is used to declare new function in some object. If I change the function's name, in Outline box each prototype function is represented 2 times instead of one. And each time a name is manipulated this happends again, so the number of functions continues to grow.. No content assist documentation for Zend Framework. Each time a build workspace operation is launched Aptana chokes on certain files which appear to be javascript files. Killing Aptana, deleting the suspected files and restarting Aptana seems to solve the problem. I t re-appears as soon as the files are put back into the project. There is a large selection of the following errors in the log file:. ""Building Workspace"" very slow, many errors in log file. Try this code and notice the incorrect colorization. Please see capture at Studio reports an error loading bundle upon opening. Steps to Replicate : 1) Open Titanium Studio Actual Results : Studio opens an error window and write this to log : !SESSION Microsystems Inc.

Actual Result not Colorized Output h3. Expected Result Display some color as per no.. Found in a customer's log file. Unfortunately no reproduction case ATM. Suggested solution: out the root cause and fix it. When the terminal screen is filled up after typing commands and the output goes passed the bottom, the text jumbles up so typing in the terminal no longer works. I attached on screenshot of what happens but it does other things in that it won't work when the content goes passed the bottom. Possibly an issue with buffer flushing.. Ruby: Problem formatting Ruby source code where block contains only comments. HTML validation filters don't work. I am using custom HTML tag - lets call it . I added rules in: Options - Aptana Studio - Validation - HTML - HTML Tidy Validator (I tried all validators on the list) To test: add new validation filter to the HTML Tidy validator * See ""specialtag is not recognized"" in the problems view The editor still shows warning message and underscores the content of the .. Major lag in editing large files with word wrap enabled. h3. Steps to Reproduce Open a css file with 1000 lines Enable word wrap Scroll to bottom of page Start typing h3. Actual Result Keyboard lag (or whatever is going on) is so significant that unexpected results happen. h3. Expected Result Normal opperation with no lag. Not sure what happened, but it seems since the last update, if I have a file that is more than a few hundred lines of code, I get significant lag happening. This doesn't happen until you start to scroll down the page.. h3. Steps to Reproduce We just upgraded to Studio and now we get a ton of JSLint errors in our code. (Seems to be because of changes to default settings?) We could put the settings into jslint comments to make it work how we want it to, but that would require adding the settings to the 300+ JavaScript files that we have on our site. That is unacceptable. We need a place to be able to specify JSLint's settings on a global level. We use JSLint on ""reconcile"" mode, and seeing all of the errors (for things like supposedly ""messy"" whitespace, using multiple 'var' statements, etc) makes the tool downright useless for the actual errors that we need it to catch. h3. Actual Result (See above) h3. Suggested solution Remove the filter box from the validator main page and have the pencil icon open up a new window (similar to how formatting works). See screenshots. For JSLint (and all validators), we would keep a filter text box, as well as have another text box where a user can specify whatever JSLint commands they'd like to issue I'm assuming this would be in the form of a string of options that would then be injected into the comments of a file before parsing.. After I updated my aptana studio (yesterday) and I restart it. The workspace and index building takes longer then 1 houre! Before it takes max. I've many projects in my workspace but after update it is not possible to work because after saving a file the workspace will be build I can stop it, but the next time it starts again. Thats a never ending story. The same I tried with singe typo3 project. It was also not possible to build the workspace in a comftable time. I'm not sure what happens but the performance is now really I also set the java-heap space to 1024m.. Building workspace and indices takes far longer than expected with JSLint enabled. HTML validator should not flag no-value boolean attributes in HTML 4. Add ability to toggle HTML Tidy rules on and off. Add editor preference to configure column cutoff for code coloring. Slow text entry with large PHP files. The following are Lexing Parsing Warnings generated by JSLint.

If there are too many branches, the Aptana GIT Implementation will not show them. Only the current branch is shown in the list, but all others are not. See attached screenshot.. Summary log from chat recorded on poker session Story Time 20120515: Ingo Muschenetz: restarting hangout. High CPU while working on a HTML + PHP file. Associating a file with an external editor only works until Aptana Studio is restarted. After closing a project and opening it up again later, GIT marks seemingly random files as being changed and then wants to commit them. I am 100% positive I did not change these files. It happens on multiple projects. In the example I show a screenshot of files in a Typo3 project, though this happens on other (non-typo3) projects as well. I never had this issue with other eclipse GIT plugins on comparable code. Included is a screenshot of the commit window, which seems to detect no difference in file content.. Aptana studio failed to comment a selected block of text, while editing a javascript source file. The error produced a stack trace on the console:. When shutting down Studio (on Windows), I noticed that it appears that the Aptana Studio process kept running and needed to be terminated manually.. JavaScript: Outline view does not descend into conditionals. Aptana Studio 3, build: The outline view doesn't display functions defined inside conditionals:. Publishing project also uploads ignored resources. Publishing a project also uploads ignores resources h3. Steps to reproduce: add new php project add .gitignore file in root of project rightclick on project publish run web deployment wizard finish web deployment wizard for an FTP server open preferences aptana studio publishing add and to ignore list press apply press ok right-click on project publish upload And both .project and .gitignore files are uploaded to server. I have also tried closing project and closing aptana after updating preferences.. Improve handling of ""Failed to parse"" for Validation. Found in a log file. It appears to happen when a file is edited outside Eclipse, ""refreshing workspace"" is turned off, and we attempt to build Suggested approach: Catch the specific exception Call refresh of the resource Try again If it still fails, alert the user (similar to how search fails) Write out this message as an to the log. From ( It appears there are at least two syntaxes we don't currently support, but should: Both return ""unexpected token (or ' '). Add ""Opened Editors"" scope. When validating the user's credentials for the JIRA login, clicking Validate behaves a little odd: the Validate button stays blue, and then a couple seconds later we get a beach ball. Also, the error message when it fails is a little obtuse since it shows the exception name - we can probably handle the specific case of bad credentials with a custom message? * Once we've validated the user's information, we should remove the field. I have setup an autosync with sftp for deployment and it works. If I delete the file, it does not get deleted on the server.. Autosync does not sync deleted files. Based on the findings for APSTUD-4690, we implement the rules in a new validator.. Building workspace hangs forever on file save. Since the last update to js files that are opened - and are not part of a Titanium project - do not get validated by jsLint. If you open a js file that is in a project and make an error, the error appears straight away. The same is not true for files outside projects, they don't get validated at all. h3. To Test Create a new JS file on your desktop. Ensure that JSLint validation is on in preferences Add the following content: Drag the file from the desktop into the editor area of Studio to open it (or open it via the File menu or Local Filesystem node) In you will be warned about the duplicate assignment of a. In the validation doesn't happen.. fails to cache remote file if parts of local cache directory are already present. Allow setting the permissions for both the upload and download of FTP files. File permissions are not preserved on file-download from No default permissions can be defined during ftp-download. (The FTP settings under ""preferences"" ""Aptana Studio"" ""publishing"" ""ftp"" only work for the upload process and publishing. See attached file. Same as ""advanced settings"" while syncing. There should also be In order to improve the process, suggest adopting a similar UI to Cyberduck (see attached image). Preserve permissions Download section Choose specific settings for files and folders. When we deploy a new Aptana (or Titanium) release, we deploy it to a new location each time on Amazon S3, or to the same location (but wiping the old contents) on It appears that the P2 system now requires the old update site to exist in order to be able to revert to the previous version. Suggest that we use the ""mirror"" task to merge in the previous versions (though Chris has suggested their might be a different approach to use as well) So, when deploying we merge in We can keep the repos to merge in on the build server (we do them as tagged builds now) and update those references as part of updating version s. However, maybe there is a better way to automatically figure out where these repos to merge in live. h3. Suggested Fix Upgrade the two deployment scripts (the bash one for Titanium Studio and the Ruby release one for Studio 3) to take a list of versions and merge those into a new repo Upload the new repo to the same location as before Test the combined version by installing Version A, upgrading to version B, and being able to revert to version A (assuming A & B are both versions on the update site). Aptana forces the path of the Document root on server to start with a "" "" (slash). In the git history view the linebreak in the commit messages is not That means that long commit messages are very hard to read. Please see the picture i added for you. You see the same log in the Terminal and in Aptana. The list view should only display the first line of the message (the ""Subject"") The details view should display the messages with proper line breaks.. This ticket involves the investigation of the complexity in replacing JSHint with our own validation framework What rules do we need to encapsulate Will the current approach (Xpath + custom AST walking) allow for the validation of all these cases For ease in migration for existing users, it is suggested we accept the current comment-based options that JSHint allows.. Investigate creating validator. This ticket involves the investigation of the complexity in replacing JSLint with our own validation framework What rules do we need to encapsulate For ease in migration for existing users, it us suggested we accept the current comment-based options that JSLint allows.. After installing standalone Aptana Studio plugin is not initialized after putting it into folder. To make clear, for Aptana Studio standalone it was possible to place and folder of some plugin into the folder and after that plugin loads automatically at studio startup. That is documented at and . h3. To reproduce Download plugin. It is small and handy plugin and always worked with all Aptana versions. Under Aptana Studio placing its files under do not make it load. Error log is empty, and Aptana starts as usual, without Regex Util plugin. The same thing (placing plugin files under folder) with Eclipse (indigo) is ok. Plugin is loaded normally as usual. Attached file is log info from Help - About Aptana Studio 3 - Installation Details - Configuration tab.. h3. Steps to reproduce Copy-paste from on the file Error occurs h3. Error Details Date: Thu Dec 08 CET 2011 Message: Error while formatting the code in your submit a bug report through Studio's support and include the relevant code which triggered this error.

I am using the latest version of Aptana as a plugin in Zend Studio When using Microsoft Filters (in this example, opacity), the line is marked as invalid syntax:. Add support for Microsoft filters syntax to CSS. See attached example. Unable to cloak folders. Why, after new updates, I am unable to cloak folders anymore? To reproduce: Set up a FTP connection with a project using the instruction here: Right-click on a folder in the project and select ""Publish Cloak this file type"". Expected result: the folder will show a cloaking decorator. Actual result: no decorator is added to the folder icon.. Use JFlex scanners for JavaScript partitioning. Use JFlex scanner for JavaScript colorization. Autocomplete (html editor) breaks multiline edit block selection mode. JavaScript: Outline view does not descend into functions. Add AST ""Live view"" to HTML editor to show the AST of a selected area of the document. When writing new rules that apply to the AST of a HTML document, it will be invaluable to get a preview of the AST of a specified area. Ideally, the live view allows users to click or select some piece of code and see the AST (or it could just be the AST of the whole document as an outline). Additionally, the user could type in a rule in the form expected by the validation engine, and see the resultant matching nodes in the tree or the document.. FTP: Changing file permissions in properties window does not change the permissions on the server. When browsing on a remote ftp server, changing file permissions in the file properties window does not ute a chmod command in the ftp console and does not make changes on the server. To test: Connect to a local or remote FTP server (I used the built-in server on OS X) Expand the site in the Remote view Right-click on a file. Change the permissions to something different. Save the properties. Note that the file permissions do not change on the server. Note that this does work with the SFTP protocol.. PHP: Assertion Failed error due to a syntax error. PHP editor crashed due to a syntax error. I was not able to reopen the file until I manually removed the following (invalid) line: Here is the log returned upon crash:. HTML Tidy: Error: String index out of range: 0. ""Short Tag"" snippet from XML autocompletes in HTML document, causing annoying content assist experience. Type: Aptana will add the closing for you Press enter (thinking your will get a new line), and a name tag is inserted. Actual result: Expected result: You can work around the issue by one of two ways: Hit ""esc"" before ""enter"" Edit the XML bundle and remove the ""short tag"" definition The XML definition should not apply in HTML, as that snippet seems It does not apply in HTML in TextMate.. User-defined functions not showing source file in content assist popup. Aptana startscreen fails with error cannot open shared object file"". Rubles don't appear to load correctly when Aptana Studio is in a directory with foreign characters. When i type in css file "" earlier i got next result: I use Aptana Studio 3, build: and after typing .class and left bracket, right bracket isn't complete and new line not created. Suggested fix: Attempt to replicate If it's an issue with our code, apply fix If it's a jRuby issue, link ticket to upstream item and place this ticket on hold.. We use a lock on the entire repo. We should have a separate lock for the config file, since most of the ""writes"" won't affect it.. Cannot format jQuery. See comments for code. The quick outline requires wildcards to search for items, whereas the outline filter does not. Please see the screenshot for an example.. Quick outline filter requires use of wildcards when searching. If a user edits the filters on a participant or modifies enablement, we need to force a clean rebuild of projects for the changes to take effect. Like JDT, we should warn the user of needing to rebuild all projects (and offer to cancel). Also, we don't need to do this if only changing reconcile options.. Set the built-in web server to use the computer's IP address Applying and restarting Aptana. Reboot your mac and open Aptana again Go run a html file as a JavaScript web application. The web server is bound to instead of the computer's IP address. Going in to change it to the computer's IP address shows that it is still set. Changing it back to clicking apply and then changing it back to the computer's IP address, applying and restarting Aptana resolves the issue temporarily.. There are an extra two blank lines in the text hover documentation. Open a new JS file Type ""var x new Array();"" Place the cursor before ""var"" and type "" **"" + Enter You will get an extra line:. Unable to create project in location with pre-existing files. If you create a new project (in my case PHP) and you point to a location which already contains files, Aptana won't allow you to create the project. You see a warning, but there is no way to skip this warning and create the project regardless.. Steps as listed here: File New File will create a new file. This will not respond to ""Undo"" (see Eclipse bug where they fixed that) To replicate: Eclipse (JDT): Navigator, but not Package Explorer or Project Explorer Titanium Studio (dev): App Explorer and Project Explorer Titanium Studio App Explorer and Project Explorer Open a file in the Editor. undo history.. Given a project with a very large html file (attached), I wanted to create new file (php). Doing so blocked Studio for 15 minutes while indexing was in progress and no way to cancel it unless I killed the application. The indexed file is not even on the same project. Indexing should not interrupt file creation.. Add Ruby documentation hovers for variables, types and methods. Add HTML documentation hovers for elements and attributes. See - description Remarks remarks Example example Specification. Investigate FTP directory failing issue to see if it's still a problem. Pre-select last used connection in connection menu drop down for repeated synchronization. I would prefer remembering of the last connection used for I have some projects deployed to more than one place (connection). When I make some little changes in the project (for example in template), it usualy relates to one specific connection. As soon as I check changes, I synchronize files with that connection. Now, whats wrong. In serie of more changes in a row, everytime I want to synchronize, I need to switch to the right connection prior to the actual because Aptana not remember last used connection. There is checkbox ""Remember my decision"" but it's unusable for my situation. I still need dialogue for selection of connection.. Add option to format object properties on separate lines. When trying to format this bit of JavaScript code, the formatter used to crash: Now, it just collapses all of the properties onto a single line. * Add UI and functionality into the formatter, allowing the properties to be formatted each to one line..

Given the following: We present content assist against the functions and properties defined in the module file * This would require changing the index to show what individual files require and filtering that in content assist.. Attached PHP file has the code that fails plus the error code Code:. PHP: Unable to format string with interleaved comments. PHP: Keep end ? on same line as previous. I badly write in English, I will write an example Aptana: Netbeans:. We have a couple classes that handle sniffing document type and then returning info on HTML tags being tags being forbidden. They're in HTMLParseState and We use this in our CA and parsing and would like to use it in Validation as well. Ideally this sort of information seems like it should be in the XMl metadata for HTML, rather than in a supporting utility class or two. New model elements Replace calls from HTMLParseState. Outline appears broken. Broken Linux links on. On the website the x64-linux links are broken for Aptana Studio.. Paste the following into a new HTML file, inside a project: Note there is an error in the gutter around alertMsg , but not in the problems view Save the file. Note, no change in the problems view Right-click on the project, and choose ""Build"" Note the problems view now contains a corresponding error. During the Aptana Studio and Titanium Studio build process, we need to create a set of JavaDocs to make it easier for end users to navigate and understand. This ideally is placed into a ""javadocs"" folder in this area so that they can be uploaded as part of the nightly sync. There should be some set of ANT tasks we can use to generate the docs. We also need to replace the default stylesheet with the JBoss one:. A number of items are written out to the log under the INFO level. However, if you have the slider set to ALL, that can provide an astronomical amount of data, particularly from the scripting plugin, assuming you have not selected particular components to debug. Add Only show ""trace"" items if level is set to and you have chosen to debug the specific component in question. This is in contrast to the current behavior for INFO where it will show all components if no specific one is selected.. We need some way to turn off validators individually, and in particular between build vs reconcile. This stems from the poor performance of the JS validators during large builds. They should default to be on for reconcile (only the ones currently on by default) and off for build (likely the same for the CSS HTML validators). We'll need a preference page similar to the validator pref page we had before (maybe just re-use fix it to work). One suggestion is to reuse the existing pref page and instead have a table at the top with two checkbox columns, one for build and one for reconcile. A less-optimal solution is to have two separate lists, one for each type of interaction. Perhaps we should say ""On Typing"" as opposed to ""Reconcile""? Perhaps that is more user-friendly? Tasks: Add some methods fields to the participants to mark them as validators Create a migration function to migrate the old pref keys to the new scheme * Some build participants need to be unchangeable or hidden from the end user (like indexing). Studio infers wrong remote path after using both ""Go Into"" and having FTP time out. APSTUD-4069 is solved, however invoking the commands listed in APSTUD-4069 results in Scripting Console errors. Steps to Replicate : 1) Open Aptana Studio 2) Open a CoffeeScript file 3) Select Commands CoffeeScript Insert Heredoc """""" Comment, Commands CoffeeScript Insert Heredoc """""" Quotes or Commands CoffeeScript Insert Heredoc ''' Quotes Actual Results : The Scripting Console will show the message : line 3: column number: command not found line 4: syntax error near unexpected token `(' line 4: `whitespace "" "" Convert 8 commands to inline Ruby, 7 of which are easy and 1 which is complicated. Git not using and from .gitconfig. I noticed that when I do a commit using the gui (specifically the Commit command in the App Explorer gear menu), git isn't using the and from the .gitconfig in my home directory. I'm running the Studio 3 Beta plugin in Galileo on Windows XP, and I'm using msysgit When I do the same commit from the git bash prompt, it works fine. Is there a separate global git config for Studio 3? Is there an easy way to sync this with the .gitconfig in my home directory?. HTML content is indexed in web projects. The information store there should be included in the Index View under a separate top-level HTML node. Content provider and label provider for HTML Query index for content * Some icons. Improve additional information popup for JavaScript. Improve additional information popup for CSS. Improve additional information popup for HTML. Amend the current hover tooltip to add a link the HTML documentation for the specified item (if available). For core HTML, JavaScript and CSS functionality where the documentation is provided by standard metadata files, the URL can be constructed to point to In-Studio help. See Studio 2 for an example of this: For other elements (like Titanium properties) perhaps there is a mechanism by which we can provide a custom resolver to generate the URL. It could also be that this might be provided by an extension point or class property when the contribution happens. See for details.. Add icon to ""Open HTML docs"" for current content assist entry for JS language. JavaScript Core Reference HTML DOM 2 Reference * Titanium Mobile Reference (if applicable) Hover and Dynamic help for functions is identical to properties, except it shows the method signature. See for information on how to contribute dynamic help. See and for the majority of the including both the top content, and the list of resources at the bottom. Suggest we try running any JS code blocks through the formatter.. Create redirects for the most common studio pages * Updating links in our current project. Right now we index the full gems installation, which can take a little bit of time if the user has a lot of gems. It also impacts lookup since they're all stored in the same index. Ideally each gem (and version) would be it's own index and would get associated with ruby projects based on Gemfile (or other files' gem requires). Parse the gem file to find the gem versions and names Content assist only on gems used * Listen to changes to gem file to update index. The diff view is not readable with the default color theme. The black bars on the black background have zero contrast with each other.. PHP: Show functions inside conditionals in Outline view. Currently it is not possible to view functions defined inside a conditional in the outline view. They appear to be ignored. without if () it works:. There is no ""length"" property in jQuery content assist. There is no ""length"" on list, though it exists in the API: There may be similar items that are missing.. Theme export not escaping certain characters, creating an invalid theme file. I exported a theme to a file, reinstall an Aptana Studio, but when I try import it, nothing happened.. JavaScript: Instance method in SDOCML file missing in content assist. Create a new SDOCML file in a web project Paste in the following: Save this file and open a new JavaScript file. Type clearCache is missing from the proposals list. When using code folding in a PHP document if the editor find an error in my code it unfold all folded block of codes (functions, Paste the following into a document: Fold both functions Select ""public"" at the beginning of one of the functions and replace it with the letter ""p"". This will force an error in the document. Both functions unfold.. Syntax errors don't appear in ruler until after save with Build Participation.. The last line in a file is not clickable. Aptana Studio initially opens files significantly slower than Studio. If the end user creates an HTML file with a JavaScript file associated via a Script tag src attribute, changes to the JavaScript file will not be visible until the HTML editor is closed and restarted. Steps to Replicate : 1) Open Aptana Studio 2) Create a JavaScript file with the content : 3) Create an HTML file in the same folder with the content : 4) Resolve the JavaScript file in the outline so scriptFun1() is visible 5) In the JavaScript file, rename the function to scriptFun2() and save 6) In the HTML file, try to refresh the Outline via the node or by editing the src attribute value Actual Results : The new function is not visible in the HTML outline until the editor is closed and restarted. Expected Results : src JavaScript file changes should be available after the JavaScript file is saved. Proposed solution: Refresh the outline, preserving the open closed states of both the HTML and JS nodes. JavaScript content assist not automatic from between contiguous braces. HTML Editor Matches Double Quotes In Text Areas, Strings and comments. : the HTML editor auto-matches double-quotes in the text area. Steps to Replicate : 1) Open Aptana Studio 2) Open an HTML file 3) Enter a double-quote between the body tags Actual Results : The editor will auto-match the double-quote. Expected Results : The HTML editor is not supposed to auto-match single or double-quotes in text, strings, or comments. If you have a pair of braces enclosed by quotes and containing a matched pair, deleting the inner and outer characters in a certain sequence will cause a newline between the braces to move the caret one space forward instead of adding a (possibly indented) newline. Steps to Replicate : 1) Open Aptana Studio 2) Open an editor 3) Enter a double quote (or a single quote if the editor matches these), brace and any character the editor will auto-match so you have something like the sequence """" 4) Delete the first quote, then the second quote, then the enclosed pair so the caret is at the pipe : 5) Enter newline Actual Results: The caret will move forward as if you entered the right arrow key. Expected Results: The editor should add a (possibly indented) newline between the braces. To Do: We expect to do the following as part of this ticket Decide what the behavior ought to be * Modify the current behavior to be in line (if necessary). XML matching tag highlighting fails. XML outline does not clear upon replacing current content with erroneous content. Move Eclipse base for Studio to and remove support for Eclipse. Find Bar in split-screen editors copies text from wrong editor. Ship PHP, Ruby and Python features separately from Studio. Add ""Connection link to Remote View menu. Ability to control the auto closing of quotes and brackets separately. When I use and in JS editor content between them is still formatted. Testcase: original code when formatted, all items in array are merged into one line. When creating a wizard, we manually composite a foreground image onto a background image, but this is an intensive process. Instead, create a utility class that a supplied top image against a standard background image on demand. Thus, if a person wants to create a new wizard image, they need not manually have to do so. It will center the top image (horizontally and vertically) on the bottom image. Aptana freezes when opening a folder while a file is being created inside it. It's the secound time that my Aptana freezes (and locks the complete OS) when i am opening a folder in the App Explorer while a file is created in the folder I'm try to open. I was able to get my system back via switching to a new shell (STRG + ALT + F1) and killing the Java pid.. PHP: Add hyphened variables to double click selection delimiters. When you double click on something like depending on where you click, Aptana will select text. If you click to foo, Aptana will select ""$foo"", if you click on ""bar"" or ""baz"" Aptana will select only that text, without dash or period. You can see Aptana and Notepad++ comparison in the attachment. Someone suggested it a while ago in We have determined that we should be supporting the addition of the hyphened text -bar, in this example). Remove Firefox installation requirement on Studio startup and instead show prompt on Firefox debug launch. Currently, we prompt the user for an install of Firefox if we can't find it at startup. We should instead do the check and install if they've chosen to debug with Firefox.. ScriptDoc Autocomplete for JavaScript functions. Investigate replacement for HTML Tidy Validator. This item manifested after pasting the set of all HTML tags from the website : Into the HTML editor and arranging them in a valid order (list is included below to speed replication) : Steps to Replicate : 1) Open Aptana Studio 2) Open saved HTML file 3) Paste above list of HTML tags into editor and begin to arrange in valid order. I continue to witness performance issues and Studio Actual Results : When I discovered this Sunday evening, several malfunctions occurred sequentially. First was a NPE, then a Heap error, and finally Studio turned unresponsive until shut down from the task manager and opened with a new workspace without the offending file, which does not contain an excessive number of tags Studio is representing this as an unbalanced tree. Below is the stack trace for the second error : !ENTRY 4 0 !MESSAGE Unhandled event loop exception !STACK 0 Java heap space at Method) at Expected Results : Files this size should not consume excessive resources. It appears this is related to HTML Tidy. We need to investigate what functions HTML Tidy currently still performs (that are not filtered out) so that we can scope how hard it will be to replace it.. Steps to reproduce: Copy into a new Web project Open up the file Turn on ""Mark Occurrences"" Click on the first instance of ""function"" note that the annotations in the side bar come up quite quickly, but profiling, it shows a significant performance hit in At this point the IDE is unusable for quite some time (10-30 seconds) See screenshots for details. I noticed that if I only allowed 100 annotations to be created, performance seemed acceptable (though still kinda slow). Set ""Mark Occurrences"" as ""off"" by default. JavaScript Window Object Content Assist Missing some height, offset and screen properties, and createPopup method. JavaScript Document Object Content Assist missing documentMode,. Exclude files from the deploy tools using paths rather than by file types. Currently there is only an option to cloak file types from the deployment assistent. But very often it's not only file types with sould be excludet. For an example. I have a PHP project remote and local, i have for example local other usernames and passwords for the database connection. So i have to skip on every deployment the or i would kill the live system. Currently there is no way, because cloaking is not realy an option. I think a textfield where i can store the complete path would be very useful. The syntax could be like in an .gitignore file.. Frequent and Random Aptana crashes. i get multiple crashes from Aptana and I notice it regularly occurs when I am switching back to it (eg. apple-tab) from another app like Chrome. It's happened to me several times today. here is the apple problem reporter info after the app crashed: See attached file for full information. Suggestions to investigate: Does it matter if the internal browser is disabled Perhaps this will dissipate with Eclipse (now built on top of Eclipse. Ubuntu: Aptana won't save editor tab sizes. PHP: Context Information fails when there is a string in the parameter list. PHP No code assist on methods. In some context locations, the code assist may pop-up automatically to suggest available options. For example, an available list of functions, variables and constants will appear after typing a PHP arrow string '- '. Call other class methods do not work. there was no code assist when used like this. Assume the following snippet: If you type d+TAB, it inserts: If instead, you menu it will insert: Expected is:. Create sub-folder under temp for our temporary files. If i work with a lot of FTP connections, after some hours my tmp directory is getting very nasty. If you have some other tools that work directly in tmp, you don't find your own files anymore. (see the screenshot) I think it would be a very nice feature if i could determain a custom path for this files. Normaly on Linux you have . You can see other tools like pulse, orbit, ssh, always using their own subdirectory.. If you have methods with long parameter descriptions, sometimes the auto complete popup it very hard to read, as shown in the attached screenshot (the code is from the Zend Framework). The content should wrap according to the width of the popup (it appears to break early here). Content assist content wraps short of popup edge. PDT WST editors are not available in an Aptana PHP project. Set ""Project Natures"" to PHP WEB ""Others"" menu. Show better error messages when invoking a command without the proper Ruby gem Installed. If the end user invokes the command ""Convert HTML to HAML"" without the appropriate Ruby Gem installed, Aptana returns an error via the scripting console. Steps to Replicate : 1) Open Aptana Studio 2) Open a saved HAML file 3) Invoke the command Commands HAML Convert HTML to HAML Actual Results : The editor returns this message to the scripting console : Expected Result : The editor could return a concise error message. Suggested approach is to add a function which can be called before running the ruby command that will check for the existence of the specified gem. If the gem is missing, it will alert the user, ideally with directions on how to install the gem. We would then need to update existing commands where appropriate (approximately 10).. PHP: Add Open Type Method PHP feature. One feature that is sorely missed is Open Type in the Eclipse PHP PDT. Attached is a screenshot of the feature in Eclipse PDT.. Word Wrap shows keybinding conflict when used as plugin in Eclipse for Java EE. It appears some users are upset by the creation of an empty Aptana Rubles folder in on startup. Given that user rubles can now be created directly in-workspace as top-level projects, the current Aptana Rubles location may be antiquated, as users will rarely have to interact with the folder directly. Viewing here: It suggests that a possible better location would be under the Alternately, we could only create the Aptana Rubles folder if a user chooses to actually download and install new Rubles.. Support editing. Support for ""requires"" and imported modules * Auto-attaching of documentation sources (see for an example of possible workflow. We ran into an issue with PATH holding cygwin paths on Windows breaking git clones. I added a method to convert between the two, but we need to make sure we convert anywhere we're not uting inside the Terminal bash.. Aptana 2 has great feature for JavaScript formatting: ""auto format code block when typing closing brace ' '"". This setting accessible in Aptana 2 from: Window - Preferences - Aptana - Editors - JavaScript - Typing - Formatting It would be nice if such feature will be presented in Aptana 3 Attached screenshot of the preferences screen in Aptana 2 and another screenshot showing formatting behavior. h3. Suggested solution Add preference (off by default) for this setting Find relevant nodes in the AST into selection and perform format Add lots of unit tests. Our current unit test coverage hovers around 30% (class, method, block, and line) We need to get this higher. Here are the classes we need to test: Please create a sub-task for the class you want to test, and edit the document to indicate you've claimed that test. If there already is a task created for a particular class, it means someone else has claimed that one, so choose another. If there are a bunch of related classes, you can group that into one task. Coverage goals for all classes below is a minimum of 100% class, 70% method, 80% block, 80% line (default Emma values in Jenkins) URIUtil. The default PMD profile is too strict for our purposes. Create a default PMD profile all developers can use to validate code correctness before checkin. Please create a profile, run it against some of our current source code to see if it reports what is expected, and pass it around to the other developers for confirmation.. The default FindBugs profile is too strict for our current code base. We need to create a more limited profile that we can use to validate all committed code for possible errors. Please create a profile, run it against some of our current source code to see if it reports what is expected, and pass it around to the other developers for confirmation.. intermittently fails in editor. There is a very strange issue that has been happening to me since I started using Aptana Studio at version when I copy (or cut) some text from the editor and paste it somewhere else in the same or different file, Aptana will paste the last thing (or second to last, depending on how you look at it) instead of the most recent thing I just copied. I thought maybe just my keyboard wasn't working, since I had never experienced something like that before. But then my co-worker (who is also using Aptana asked me if I was experiencing copy paste issues too. That's when I knew I wasn't the only one. We noticed that the times when he can't copy paste is when Aptana is using up 100% of the CPU. So, not sure if there is another bug and this is just a side-afect, or if this is a bug that can be isolated. I don't know how to replicate this. All I know is that it is happening at seemingly random times. Update: Some people have reported relief after unbinding the shortcut 'command + c' from 'copy' under Unbinding this shortcut resolved the issue of copy paste randomly not working. It also appears that this is a long-standing Eclipse issue: Which suggests that there is some more investigation to do here.. Mac OS X Lion has a full screen feature for a lot of native apps. It would be great for Aptana to have a feature like this.. Implement a new JavaScript validation framework. We have multiple different validators for JS. They are inefficient, out of date, and nearly Propose creating an infrastructure to replace this with a single way of defining rules. Brief requirements: Should encapsulate these rules ( It should allow for style usage validation for things like Titanium Mobile projects. This kind of validation might only happen in JS files in Titanium Mobile projects It should allow for cross-file validation. Ideally, those rules exist in some form that can be modified and converted into our new format.. This would crib from the previous implementation we had for Aptana Studio some years ago: User needs to set up their JIRA account. There should be a preference area for that When filing a bug, ask them the following: A summary of the issue (mandatory) Steps to reproduce the problem (mandatory) Include log file, current platform configuration and any other log items If possible, properly assign component and scope to the item in question (should be part of the method call instantiating this dialog) Allow them to attach a screenshot The same item would be available from the file menu, though some of these things would not be filled out component, scope). This would use the JIRA API to submit the bug (. ""New From Template"" should list all possible file types, and provide a template option for each. Add XML parse-level validation. Currently, to set PHP up to preview against a local web server, a user needs to follow the directions here which are overly complicated (something like 5+ major steps) Suggest instead the following: Note: This is more similar to NetBeans than PhpStorm. The latter just assumes you have a PHP server already installed. On create new project first screen, ask: Radio Button: () Use local web server () Use remote web server If ""Use local web server,"" allow them to create a new one (unlikely that they could reuse existing) If remote web server, allow them to create a new FTP SFTP connection (perhaps they could reuse existing?), and then specify the remote url for preview On creating the project, automatically do the following: This would mean creating something like project name: myproject, project location Create a new run configuration with the preview server above create the FTP connection as specified above Create a new run configuration with the preview server above Thoughts appreciated.. Expand Collapse icons in Project Explorer drawn with 1px borders. Add F2 support for Content Assist Hover. F2 should pop up the content assist tooltip, or if hovering over content, F2 will provide focus.. Implement improved terminal hyperlink detection. On terminal windows with a long history of output (a couple pages), scrolling up with the mouse wheel will jump back down once it reaches a certain point. However, if you manually drag the scroll bar up, you can see history beyond the jumping point. I've seen this reproducible on Allen's machine when you tail rails logs. You can see similar symptoms in the attached movie. A short investigation showed that the issue relates to the implementation of hyperlink detection in Terminal. Disabling hyperlink detection eliminates the issue. Suggested fix: Re-implement hyperlink detection code to make it free of issues.. Chromium: Update WebKit Browser implementation to the latest source base. From the current system: template ""Custom Template"" do t "" .html"" end By default this WOULD DO environment substitution. Also add a setting to allow turning on off parameter substitution (identical to project templates). Menus aren't visible in Ubuntu Unity window manager. Aptana doesn't show the menu bar in Unity window manager on Ubuntu. When editing HTML, CSS and Javascript files, the non-selected entries in the code completion widget are all white (see attached screenshot). The colors stay the same regardless of the Gnome theme selected. The colors of the tooltip correctly matches the system colors, but code completion is always displayed like this. When opening a file in a non-aptana editor, the code completion widget correctly matches the color of the tooltip. I run Ubuntu and Aptana Studio. No file system is defined for scheme. From the log file:. There's still no multi line Now I know there's the DRY principle that any good coder should utilize. But there's just tons of situations where it's needed. Like where the DRY principle is practically not applicable. Also searching other's code for a specific line is much easier if you can just paste a chunk of code into the search bar. You know - tutorials - that some of us have to do to stay on top. In the meantime, you'll have to use regular expressions (use R for carriage returns). Longer-term, suggest modifying the find bar to allow for a ""multi-line"" option. Proposed spec:. Updating to latest RCP on dev installs JDT plugins. PHP: Error updating PHP error markers. Add ability to to select word via camel case. In my old Aptana2 + PDT the camelCaseWord. In the current version the whole word in selected. Is it possible to change this behaviour somehow (maybe with an option)?. Find dialog cause text selection to ""invert"" colors. This is what happens: I select some text - I open the find replace dialog (I press CTRL+F then click on the magnifier icon in the search bar) At this point the selection is gone (like it is ""inverted"" or something similar), so the option to find replace only in selected line is useless. I'm on the latest build (win7) and never experienced this before. The error log is clean.. Eclipse PDT provides the option to have trailing whitespace automatically removed from files on save from the end of a line where it has no impact). Is it possible you could add this useful feature?. Project Explorer is showing duplicate files and folders. In the attached image, Project you can see the current improper behavior. In attached image, C-C++ you can see the expected behavior. The view is proper in Project Explorer for Web Projects. This is with a new install of Eclipse Helios CDT and Aptana Studio 3 on Arch Linux. This also appears in a few other circumstances (see linked issues).. This is something that was shipped with (skipped out on so don't know if it's there). Don't know if this is planned for (on the product page I've seen that JS debugging is coming soon), yet it would be great if this were to be found into Aptana again (same goes for the ability to run a script through the PHP parser to get the output). I've found the debugger to be one of the main Aptana features I use during my lectures (I'm a lecturer at a technical university), helping the students to understand what's going on on ""the inside"" of a PHP process.. Trying to get started with Aptana Studio Debugger on a standalone install of Aptana Studio (Mac OS X - Intel). Following online help: ""This walkthrough will instruct you how to install the Aptana JavaScript debugger, add a breakpoint to your code, and display the current values of your variables. 1. Import the debugging sample as a project. In the Samples View, expand the Aptana Studio Samples node. But in the Samples View I don't have the specified node, I only have samples related to plugins I have installed. Where do I get the Aptana Studio Samples node ?. Aptana Studio does not ship with debugger sample. Given this pattern: Aptana Studio is not able to recognise this pattern correctly. I wonder if it's possible to tell Aptana with ScriptDoc. If yes, how? I've only seen comments for classes. Additionally var self ; could be replaced by a super constructor, which is not working either. Can I expect this to be supported naturally by Aptana soon? I'm really searching for a good javascript IDE which also supports this kind of writing javascript in a way.. singleton scriptdoc code completion. Dragging an image into the HTML editor should create an image tag. Dragging an image into the editor should create a img tag. You can view this behavior in TextMate. Dropping an image onto the HTML editor inserts an image tag with the relative path to the image (from this HTML file), the hight and width, and the alt text as the version of the filename: dragging gives me:. PHP Autocompletion for parent methods. When you overwrite a parent method you often need to call it from the new method, example: Aptana does not autocomplete the methods after Suggested fix: Attempt to replicate Check to see if the item is fixed in or in a newer version of the parsers If not in our code and can't be fixed, link to PDT issue referencing the problem.

Improve text hover for CSS property names. Reduce number of refreshes in Git Index and reduce work done during refresh. Previously I thought we could entirely remove refreshes when files change inside a git connected project. Turns out that we couldn't but there are other things we can do: - When we get resource change events, only update the changed files, don't do a full batch refresh. - Don't call batch refreshes from some actions like deleting files folder or moving files through our UI. The connected filewatcher on the repo should pick up a file event or two to the ""index"" file which will trigger a batch refresh. - When we do refresh we call one process and then we spawn off 3 parallel jobs to each run another process to update our listings. We may be able to reduce the number of processes down to as low as one in most cases (or two in worst case).. Improve Unit test coverage on the 'participant' branch.

If you are pasting a File in the remote view (FTP connection) by selecting the parent folder manually, the Name Conflict window is popping up. This is correct, but this window is causing a memory peak and the complete Aptana IDE is freezing to death. It takes more than 20 secounds for one letter to show up in the input field. I am not quite sure, but i think is has something to do with Aptana waiting for the FTP LIST Command. Greetings Leo.

If no cpu limits are set then it might starve other utors tasks on the slave violating isolation guarantees. Same goes with memory.

Adding HTTP authentication to these endpoints is a bit complicated since they are defined in code that is shared by the master and agent.

Running `sudo make check` on CentOS for Mesos causes several several. Failing ROOT tests in on CentOS. If I set on the master, framework and slave authentication are allowed, but not required. On the other hand, http authentication is now required for authenticated endpoints (currently only ` shutdown`). That means that I cannot enable framework or slave authentication without also enabling http endpoint This is undesirable. Framework and slave authentication have separate flags and to require authentication for each. It would be great if there was also such a flag for http Or maybe we get rid of these flags altogether and rely on ACLs to determine which principals are even allowed to authenticate for each.

After a series of ping-failures, the master considers the slave lost and calls shutdownSlave, requiring such a slave that reconnects to kill its tasks and re-register as a new slaveId. On the other side, after a similar timeout, the slave will consider the master lost and try to detect a new master. These timeouts are currently hardcoded constants (5 * 15s), which may not be well-suited for all scenarios. - Some clusters may tolerate a longer slave process restart period, and wouldn't want tasks to be killed upon reconnect. - Some clusters may have higher-latency networks or for volunteer computing efforts), and would like to tolerate longer periods without communication.

182,mesos,avinash@mesosphere.io,"I am not sure a single end point serve any purpose here. The endpoints need to be canonical since the operator would want to rebootstrap each of these entities (isolators) individually (there is no dependency between them. This implies that if we have a single end point something will have route the requests to right isolator (probably the which will automatically happen if at the `libprocess` level if we separate end points for each isolator.. Currently there are no default `network` isolators for With the development of the `network cni` isolator we have an interface to run Mesos on multitude of IP networks. Given that its based on an open standard (the CNI spec) which is gathering a lot of traction from vendors (calico, weave, coreOS) and already works on some default networks (bridge, ipvlan, macvlan) it makes sense to make it as the default network isolator.. Setup proper etc hostname, etc hosts and for containers in network cni isolator.. Most docker and appc images wish to expose ports that micro-services are listening on, to the outside world. When containers are running on bridged (or ptp) networking this can be achieved by installing port forwarding rules on the agent (using iptables). This can be done in the `network cni` isolator. The reason we would like this functionality to be implemented in the `network cni` isolator, and not a CNI plugin, is that the specifications currently do not support specifying port forwarding rules. Further, to install these rules the isolator needs two pieces of information, the exposed ports and the IP address associated with the container. Bother are available to the isolator.. But how would the CNI isolator know if the underlying plugin has the capability or not? Or for that matter the parameters that it needs to pass to the plugin?. Introduce a port field in in order to set exposed ports for a container.. Networking isolators such as `network cni` need to learn about ports that a container wishes to be exposed to the outside world. This can be achieved by adding a field to the protobuf and allowing the to set these fields to inform the isolator of the ports that the container wishes to be exposed.. Get container status information in slave.. As part of MESOS-4487 an interface will be introduce into the to allow agents to retrieve container state information. The agent needs to use this interface to retrieve container state information during status updates from the utor. The container state information can be then use by the agent to expose various isolator specific configuration (for IP address allocated by network isolators, net cls handles allocated by isolator), that has been applied to the container, in the endpoint.. The isolator is responsible for allocating network handles to containers launched within a net cls cgroup. The isolator needs to expose these handles to the containerizer as part of the when the containerizer queries the status() method of the isolator. The information itself will go as part of a `CgroupInfo` protobuf that will be defined as part of MESOS-4488 .. The isolator needs to expose handles in the ContainerStatus. Introduce status() interface in `Containerizer`. In the Containerizer, during container isolation, the isolators end up modifying the state of the containers. Examples would be IP address allocation to a container by the 'network isolator, or net cls handle allocation by the cgroup net cls isolator. Often times the state of the container, needs to be exposed to operators through the end-point. For operators or frameworks might want to know the IP-address configured on a particular container, or the net cls handle associated with a container to configure the right TC rules. However, at present, there is no clean interface for the slave to retrieve the state of a container from the Containerizer for any of the launched containers. Thus, we need to introduce a `status` interface in the base class, in order for the slave to expose container state information in its. As part of implementing the net cls cgroup isolator we need a mechanism to manage the minor handles that will be allocated to containers when they are associated with a net cls cgroup. The network-handle manager needs to provide the following functionality: a) During normal operation keep track of the free and allocated network handles. There can be a total of 64K such network handles. b) On startup, learn the allocated network handle by walking the net cls cgroup tree for mesos and build a map of free network handles available to the agent.. The net cls cgroup associates a 16-bit major and 16-bit minor network handle to packets originating from tasks associated with a specific net cls cgroup. In mesos we need to give the operator the ability to fix the 16-bit major handle used in an agent (the minor handle will be allocated by the agent. See MESOS-4345). Fixing the parent handle on the agent allows operators to install default firewall rules using the parent handle to enforce a default policy (say DENY ALL) for all container traffic till the container is allocated a minor handle. A simple way to achieve this requirement is to pass the major handle as a flag to the agent at startup.. ",15,872,5192
183,mesos,jieyu,"Currently, if a container uses container image, we'll do a bind mount of its sandbox ( - in the host mount namespace. However, doing the mounts in the host mount table is not ideal. That complicates both the cleanup path and the recovery path. Instead, we can do the sandbox bind mount in the container's mount namespace so that cleanup and recovery will be greatly simplified. We can setup mount propagation properly so that persistent volumes mounted at xxx can be propagated into the container. Here is a simple proof of concept: Console 1: Console 2: Console 1: Console 2:. does not handle empty string correctly.. Executor env variables should not be leaked to the command task.. Currently, command task inherits the env variables of the command utor. This is less ideal because the command utor environment variables include some Mesos internal env variables like MESOS XXX and Also, this behavior does not match what Docker containerizer does. We should construct the env variables from scratch for the command task, rather than relying on inheriting the env variables from the command utor.. The rationale behind this change is that many of the image specifications Docker Appc) are not just for filesystems. They also specify runtime configurations environment variables, volumes, etc) for the container. Provisioner should return those runtime configurations to the Mesos containerizer and Mesos containerizer will delegate the isolation of those runtime configurations to the relevant isolator. Here is what it will be look like eventually. We could do those changes in phases: 1) Provisioner will return a ProvisionInfo which includes a 'rootfs' and image specific runtime configurations (could be the Docker Appc manifest). 2) Then, the Mesos containerizer will generate a (a protobuf which includes rootfs, sandbox, docker appc manifest, similar to OCI's host independent and pass that to each isolator in 'prepare'. Imaging in the future, a takes the docker manifest from and prepare the container. 3) The isolator's prepare function will return a (contains environment variables, namespaces, which will be used by Mesos containerize to launch containers. Imaging that information will be passed to the launcher in the future. We can do the renaming - later.. So that when a user task is forked, it does not hold extra references to the sandbox mount and provisioner bind backend mounts. If we don't do that, we could get the following error message when cleaning up bind backend mount points and sandbox mount points.. When running the tests as root, we found fails consistently on some platforms. Turns out that the 'rmdir' after the 'umount' fails with EBUSY because there's still some references to the mount. FYI. Removing mount point fails with EBUSY in. This is related to MESOS-3095 and MESOS-3227. The idea is that we should allow command utor to run under host filesystem and provision the filesystem for the user. The command line utor will then chroot into user's root filesystem. This solves the issue that the command utor is not launchable in the user specified root filesystem. The design doc is here:. Appc spec specifies two image discovery mechanisms: simple and meta discovery. We need to have an abstraction for image discovery in AppcStore. For MVP, we can implement the simple discovery first. Update: simple discovery is removed from the spec. Meta discovery is the only discovery mechanism right now in the spec. Simple discovery is already shipped (we support an arbitrary operator specified ). So this ticket should focus on implementing Meta discovery.. Implement a utility for computing hash. Syscall 'pivot root' requires that the old and the new root are not in the same filesystem. Otherwise, the user will receive a ""Device or resource busy"" error. Currently, we rely on the provisioner to prepare the rootfs and do proper bind mount if needed so that pivot root can succeed. The drawback of this approach is that it potentially pollutes the host mount table which requires cleanup logics. For instance, in the test, we create a test rootfs by copying the host files. We need to do a self bind mount so that we can pivot root on it. That pollute the host mount table and it might leak mounts if test crashes before we do the lazy umount: What I propose is that we always perform a recursive self bind mount of rootfs itself in (after enter the new mount namespace). Seems that this is also done in libcontainer:. Marco, can you re-run the failing tests using and paste the results here? Thanks. Implement OverlayFS based provisioner backend. Implement copy based provisioner backend. Support pre-fetching images. Default container images can be specified with the flag to the slave. This may be a large image that will take a long time to initially when the first container is provisioned. Add optional support to start fetching the image when the slave starts and consider not registering until the fetch is complete. To extend that, we should support an operator endpoint so that operators can specify images to pre-fetch.. Resource estimator obviously need this information to calculate, say the usage slack. Now the question is how. There are two approaches: 1) Pass in the allocated resources for each utor through the interface. 2) Let containerizer return total resources allocated for each container when 'usages()' are invoked. I would suggest to take route (1) for several reasons: 1) Eventually, we'll need to pass in slave's total resources to the resource estimator (so that RE can calculate allocation slack). There is no way that we can get that from containerizer. The slave's total resources keep changing due to dynamic reservation. So we cannot pass in the slave total resources during 2) The current implementation of usages() might skip some containers if it fails to get statistics for that container (not an error). This will cause in-complete information to the RE. 3) We may want to calculate 'unallocated total - allocated' so that we can send allocation slack as well. Getting 'total' and 'allocated' from two different components might result in inconsistent value. Remember that 'total' keeps changing due to dynamic reservation.. Implement AppC image provisioner.. Introduce filesystem provisioner abstraction. Right now, the resource monitor returns a Usage which contains ContainerId, ExecutorInfo and In order for resource estimator qos controller to calculate usage slack, or tell if a container is using revokable resources or not, we need to expose the Resources that are currently assigned to the container. This requires us the change the containerizer interface to get the Resources as well while calling 'usage()'.. commit Author: Jie Yu Date: Wed May 6 2015 -0700 Added resources estimator abstraction for Review:. Right now, we use a sleep command to control the duration of perf sampling: This causes an additional process the sleep process) to be forked and causes troubles for us to terminate the perf sampler once the slave exits (See MESOS-2462). Seems that the additional sleep process is not necessary. The slave can just monitor the duration and send a SIGINT to the perf process when duration elapsed. This will cause the perf process to output the stats and terminate.. This is tricky in the case when a persistence id is re-used. When a persistent volume is destroyed explicitly by the framework, master deletes all information about this volume. That mean the master no longer has the ability to check if the persistence id is re-used (and reject the later attempt). On the slave side, we'll use some GC policy to remove directories associated with deleted persistent volumes (similar to how we GC sandboxes). That means the persistent volume directory won't be deleted immediately when the volume is destroyed by the framework explicitly. When the same persistence id is reused, we'll see the persistent volume still exists and we need to cancel the GC of that directory (similar to what we cancel the GC for meta directories during runTask).. Maintain persistent disk resources in master memory.. Maintain an in-memory data structure to track persistent disk resources on each slave. Update this data structure when slaves etc.. Looks like the TX RX network stats reported is the reverse of the actual network stats. The reason is because we simply get TX RX data from veth on the host. Since veth pair is a tunnel, the ingress of veth on host is the egress of eth0 in container (and vice versa). Therefore, we need to flip the data we got from veth.. As we introduce DiskInfo and reservation for Resource. We need to change the C++ Resources abstraction to properly deal with merge split of resources with those additional fields. Also, the existing C++ 'Resources' interfaces are poorly designed. Some of them are confusing and unintuitive. Some of them are overloaded with too many For instance, This interface in non-intuitive because A < B doesn't imply !(B < A). This one is also non-intuitive because if 'left' is not compatible with 'right', the result is 'left' (why not right???). Similar for operator '-'. This one assume Resources is flattened, but it might not be. As we start to introduce persistent disk resources (MESOS-1554), things will get more complicated. For example, one may want to get two types of 'disk()' functions: one returns the ephemeral disk bytes (with no disk info), one returns the total disk bytes (including ones that have disk info). We may wanna introduce a concept about Resource that indicates that a resource cannot be merged or split atomic?). Since we need to change this class anyway. I wanna take this chance to refactor it.. Refactor the C++ Resources abstraction for DiskInfo. Expose RTT in container stats. I would like to volunteer to be the release manager for which will be releasing the following major features: - Docker support in Mesos (MESOS-1524) - Container level network monitoring for mesos containerizer (MESOS-1228) - Authorization (MESOS-1342) - Framework rate limiting (MESOS-1306) - Enable building against installed third-party dependencies (MESOS-1071) I would like to track blockers for the release on this ticket.. If a network partition occurs between a Master and Slave, the Master will remove the Slave (as it fails health check) and mark the tasks being run there as LOST. However, the Slave is not aware that it has been removed so the tasks will continue to run. (To clarify a little bit: neither the master nor the slave receives 'exited' event, indicating that the connection between the master and slave is not closed). There are at least two possible approaches to solving this issue: 1. Introduce a health check from Slave to Master so they have a consistent view of a network partition. We may still see this issue should a one-way connection error occur. 2. Be less aggressive about marking tasks and Slaves as lost. Wait until the Slave reappears and reconcile then. We'd still need to mark Slaves and tasks as potentially lost (zombie state) but maybe the Scheduler can make a more intelligent decision.. ",32,1819,11030

Enable actors to pass an authentication realm to libprocess. To prepare for MESOS-4902, the Mesos master and agent need a way to pass the desired authentication realm to libprocess. Since some endpoints (like ) get installed in libprocess, the master agent should be able to specify during initialization what authentication realm the endpoints will be authenticated under.. Add authentication to remaining agent endpoints. In addition to the endpoints addressed by MESOS-4850 and MESOS-5152, the following endpoints would also benefit from HTTP both* the master and agent in tests. However, this wouldn't allow us to test scenarios where HTTP authentication is enabled on one but disabled on the other.. Add authentication to agent endpoints state and flags.

Enable HTTP authentication () 2. Specify credentials () 3. Specify HTTP authenticators (). When frameworks reserve resources, the validation of the operation ensures that the of the reservation matches the of the framework. For the case of the operator endpoint, however, the operator has no role to validate, so this check isn't performed. This means that if an ACL exists which authorizes a framework's principal to reserve resources, that same principal can be used to reserve resources for any role through the operator endpoint. We should restrict reservations made through the operator endpoint to specified roles. A few possibilities: A second ACL could be added for authorization of operations, with an of * Our conception of the object in the ACL could be expanded to include role information,. ` reserve` and endpoints allow operations for any role. Design doc for scheduler HTTP Stream IDs. This ticket is for the design of HTTP stream IDs, for use with HTTP schedulers. These IDs allow Mesos to distinguish between different instances of HTTP framework schedulers.. This ticket is the first in a series that adds authorization support for persistent volume creation and destruction. Persistent volumes should be authorized with the of the reserving entity (framework or master). The idea is to introduce and into the ACL.

Picojson supports a streaming mode in which a stream containing a series of JSON values can be repeatedly parsed.

A pull request has been filed for this change at and if it's merged, we can switch to the two-argument function call. In the meantime, we should provide such input validation ourselves in .. Introduce stream IDs in HTTP Scheduler API. Currently, the HTTP Scheduler API has no concept of Sessions aka or a . This is useful in some failure scenarios. As of now, if a framework fails over and then subscribes again with the same with the option set, the Mesos master would subscribe it. If the previous instance of the tries to send a Call , with the same previous set, it would be still accepted by the master leading to erroneously killing a task. This is possible because we do not have a way currently of distinguishing connections. It used to work in the previous driver implementation due to the master also performing a check to verify if they matched and only then allowing the call. Following the design process, we will implemented ""stream IDs"" for Mesos HTTP schedulers; each ID will be associated with a single subscription connection, and the scheduler must include it as a header in all non-subscribe calls sent to the master..

Logs from the Mesosphere CI on CentOS 6, with libevent and SSL enabled. Add framework authorization for persistent volume. This is the third in a series of tickets that adds authorization support to persistent volumes. When a framework creates a persistent volume, ""create"" ACLs are checked to see if the framework or the operator is authorized to create persistent volumes. If not authorized, the create operation is rejected. When a framework destroys a persistent volume, ""destroy"" ACLs are checked to see if the framework or the operator is authorized to destroy the persistent volume created by a framework or operator If not authorized, the destroy operation is rejected. A separate ticket will use the structures created here to enable authorization of the "" create"" and "" destroy"" HTTP endpoints:. Add 'principal' field to. libprocess uses a set of environment variables to modify its behaviour; however, these variables are not documented anywhere, nor it is defined where the documentation should be.

After searching in the code, these are the variables which need to be documented:. Add operator endpoints to create destroy persistent volumes.. Persistent volumes will not be released automatically. So we probably need an endpoint for operators to forcefully release persistent volumes. We probably need to add principal to Persistence struct and use ACLs to control who can release what.

On Linux, retrying close on EINTR is dangerous because the fd is already released and we may accidentally close a newly opened fd (from another thread), see: It appears that other OSes, like HPUX, require a retry of close on EINTR.

Some more links for posterity:. Perf event isolator stops performing sampling if a single timeout occurs.. Currently the perf event isolator times out a sample after a fixed extra time of 2 seconds on top of the sample time elapses: This should be based on the reap interval maximum. Also, the code stops sampling altogether when a single timeout occurs. We've observed time outs during normal operation, so it would be better for the isolator to continue performing perf sampling in the case of timeouts.

When a slave re-registers with the master, it currently sends the latest task state for all tasks that are not both terminal and acknowledged. However, reconciliation assumes that we always have the latest unacknowledged state of the task represented in the master. As a result, updates are possible, (1) Slave has task T in TASK FINISHED, with unacknowledged updates: . (2) Master fails over. (3) New master re-registers the slave with T in TASK FINISHED. (4) Reconciliation request arrives, master sends TASK FINISHED. (5) Slave sends TASK RUNNING to master, master sends TASK RUNNING. I think the fix here is to preserve the task state invariants in the master, namely, that the master has the latest unacknowledged state of the task. This means when the slave re-registers, it should instead send the latest acknowledged state of each task.. The slave does not send pending tasks during. In what looks like an oversight, the pending tasks and utors in the slave are not sent in the message. For tasks, this can lead to spurious TASK LOST notifications being generated by the master when it falsely thinks the tasks are not present on the slave.. As we update the Master to keep tasks in memory until they are both terminal and acknowledged (MESOS-1410), the lifetime of tasks in Mesos will look as follows: In the current form of the slave sends to the master all tasks that are not both terminal and acknowledged. At any point in the above lifecycle, the slave's message can reach the master. Note the following properties: The master may have a non-terminal task, not present in the slave's message. The master may have a non-terminal task, present in the slave's message but in a different state. The slave's message may contain a terminal unacknowledged task unknown to the master. In the current master slave code, the master assumes that case (1) is because a launch task message was dropped, and it sends TASK LOST. We've seen above that (1) can happen even when the task reaches the slave correctly, so this can lead to inconsistency! After chatting with , we're considering updating the reconciliation to occur as follows: Slave sends all tasks that are not both terminal and acknowledged, during This is the same as before. If the master sees tasks that are missing in the slave, the master sends the tasks that need to be reconciled to the slave for the tasks. This can be piggy-backed on the message. The slave will send TASK LOST if the task is not known to it. Preferably in a retried manner, unless we update socket closure on the slave to force a.

But these schedulers might consider themselves ""registered"" in a one-way network partition scenario. 2) Any calls from the scheduler is still accepted, which leaves the scheduler in a starved, but state. See the related issue for more context: MESOS-5180 There should be an additional guard for registered, but schedulers here: The HTTP API already does this: Since the scheduler driver cannot return a 403, it may be necessary to return a and force the scheduler to abort.. The existing implementation of the scheduler driver does not re-register with the master under some network partition cases. When a scheduler registers with the master: 1) master links to the framework 2) framework links to the master It is possible for either of these links to break the master changing. (Currently, the scheduler driver will only re-register if the master changes). If both links break or if just link (1) breaks, the master views the framework as and . This means the framework will not receive any more events (such as offers) from the master until it re-registers. There is currently no way for the scheduler to detect a one-way link breakage. if link (2) breaks, it makes (almost) no difference to the scheduler. The scheduler usually uses the link to send messages to the master, but libprocess will create another socket if the persistent one is not available. To fix link breakages for (1+2) and (2), the scheduler driver should implement a event handler for the master's and trigger a master (re-)detection upon a disconnection. This in turn should make the driver (re)-register with the master. The scheduler library already does this: See the related issue MESOS-5181 for link (1) breakage..

Similarly, we document the master state endpoint as , whereas the preferred name is now just , and so on for most of the other endpoints.

But certainly it seems like we should encourage people to use the shorter paths, not the longer ones.. Previously, all status update messages from the utor were forwarded by the agent to the master in the order that they had been received.

The fix should be simple: If SSL is enabled, connections should be made with HTTPS instead of HTTP.. If is enabled on a master, frameworks attempting to use the HTTP Scheduler API can't register. is already supported for HTTP based frameworks.. Implement AuthN handling in Master for the Scheduler endpoint. If you pass a nonsense string for ""master"" into a framework using the C++ HTTP scheduler library, the framework segfaults. For example, using the example frameworks: Results in: Results in. AFAICT, HTTP Pipelining is defined only for requests to the same . It does not guarantee that requests to two different URL's on the same server would return responses in order. In fact, this would be quite obvious by this example: Let's say your server hosts two and , and the request is first sent to , then to . It would always be possible that the computation done by the URL, would be more then and might in turn make return first then . Can you point me out to any bits in the RFC that discuss the behavior you outlined in the example ?. If the number of framework created exceeds the lib process threads then during master failover the zookeeper updates can cause deadlock. On a machine with 24 cpus, if the framework count exceeds 24 then when the master fails over all the libprocess threads block updating the cache ( GroupProcess) leading to deadlock. Below is the stack trace of one the libprocess thread : Solution: Create master detector per url instead of per framework. Will send the review request.. Currently, the HTTP Scheduler API has no concept of Sessions aka or a . This is useful in some failure scenarios. As of now, if a framework fails over and then subscribes again with the same with the option set. The Mesos master would subscribe it. If the previous instance of the tries to send a Call , with the same previous set, it would be still accepted by the master leading to erroneously killing a task. This is possible because we do not have a way currently of distinguishing connections. It used to work in the previous driver implementation due to the master also performing a check to verify if they matched and only then allowing the call.. Introduce sessions in HTTP Scheduler API Subscribed Responses. V1 API java protos are not generated. The java protos for the V1 api should be generated according to the Makefile; however, they do not show up in the generated build directory.. Add an abstraction to manage the life cycle of file descriptors. The Mesos UI is broken, it seems to fail to represent JSON from state. This may have been introduced with. Refactor Status Update method on Slave to handle HTTP based Executors. Currently, our testing infrastructure does not have a mechanism of HTTP events of a particular type from the Scheduler API response stream. We need a abstraction that can help us to filter a particular event type. This helper code is duplicated in at least two places currently, Scheduler Primitives tests. - The solution can be as trivial as moving this helper function to a common test-header. - Implement a similar to what we do for other protobufs via .. Currently , in libprocess, does not support HTTP pipelining. Each call as of know sends in the header, thereby, signaling to the server to close the TCP socket after the response. We either need to create a new interface for supporting HTTP pipelining , or modify the existing to do so. This is needed for the library to make sure ""Calls"" are sent in order to the master. Currently, in order to do so, we send in the next request only after we have received a response for an earlier call that results in degraded performance.. Agent : Create Basic Functionality to handle call endpoint. This is the first basic step in ensuring the basic call functionality: - Set up the route on the agent for utor"" endpoint. - The endpoint should perform basic validation and return for now. - Introduce initial tests in that just verify the status code.. call endpoint on the slave will return a 202 accepted code but has to do some basic validations before. In case of invalidation it will return a back to the client. - We need to create the required infrastructure to validate the request and then process it similar to in the check if the protobuf is properly initialized, has the required attributes set pertaining to the call message etc.. This was needed for testing the call HTTP endpoint on master. Submitted a diff up for review : ( is still a work in progress ). Implement the Events stream on slave for Call endpoint. ",39,1763,10018
190,mesos,kaysoky,"The existing implementation of the scheduler driver does not re-register with the master under some network partition cases. When a scheduler registers with the master: 1) master links to the framework 2) framework links to the master It is possible for either of these links to break the master changing. (Currently, the scheduler driver will only re-register if the master changes). If both links break or if just link (1) breaks, the master views the framework as and . This means the framework will not receive any more events (such as offers) from the master until it re-registers. There is currently no way for the scheduler to detect a one-way link breakage. if link (2) breaks, it makes (almost) no difference to the scheduler. The scheduler usually uses the link to send messages to the master, but libprocess will create another socket if the persistent one is not available. To fix link breakages for (1+2) and (2), the scheduler driver should implement a event handler for the master's and re-register in this case. See the related issue MESOS-5181 for link (1) breakage.. The s have a custom helper for setting up ACLs in the : This is no longer necessary with implicit roles.. fails on CentOS 6. sometimes fails on CentOS 7 with this kind of output: often has this output: Whether SSL is configured makes no difference. This test may also fail on other platforms, but more rarely.. Tests that use the test helper are generally fragile when the test fails an assert expect in the middle of the test. This is because the helper takes raw pointer arguments, which may be In case of an assert failure, the test immediately exits (destroying stack allocated objects) and proceeds onto test cleanup. The test cleanup may dereference some of these destroyed objects, leading to a test crash like: The helper should take arguments instead. This also means that we can remove the helper from most of these tests.. Mostly copied from A subprocess inheriting the environment variables may run into some accidental fatalities: Subprocess uses libprocess Subprocess is something else Subprocess sets inherits the same by accident Bind failure - exit Nothing happens (?) Subprocess sets a different on purpose Bind success (?) Nothing happens (?) (?) means this is usually the case, but not 100%. A complete fix would look something like: The parts of dealing with libprocess & libmesos should be refactored into libprocess as a helper. We would use this helper for the Containerizer, Fetcher, and module. * If the call is given , we can LOG(WARN) and unset the env var locally.. Similar segfault appeared again, this time during (which appeared to be near successful completion). Separated out the zookeeper segfault:. Support docker runtime configuration env var from image.. Whenever a scheduler accepts an inverse offer, Mesos will print a line like this in the master logs: Inverse offers should not trigger this warning..

Adding a hook inside the Docker containerizer is slightly more involved than the Mesos containerizer.

The status updates for each task are not necessarily received in the same order as launching the tasks. See for the explanation. The related logs are above the comment.. It might also be worthwhile to check if the tests fail without .. The documentation currently assumes that oversubscribed resources () are the only type of revocable resources. Optimistic offers will add a second type of revocable resource () that should not be acted upon by components. For example, the says the following: NOTE: If any resource used by a task or utor is revocable, the whole container is treated as a revocable container and can therefore be killed or throttled by the QoS Controller. which we may amend to something like: NOTE: If any resource used by a task or utor is revocable usage slack, the whole container is treated as an oversubscribed container and can therefore be killed or throttled by the QoS Controller..

(Optional) Clean up . * Wrap everything up in .. Two patches from some of my initial investigation into the approach: Update to code:. Test-only libprocess. Libprocess initialization includes the spawning of a variety of global processes and the creation of the server socket which listens for incoming requests. Some properties of the server socket are configured via environment variables, such as the IP and port or the SSL configuration. In the case of tests, libprocess is initialized once per test binary. This means that testing different configurations (SSL in particular) is cumbersome as a separate process would be needed for every test case. Add some optional code between some tests like: See for more on .. In order to write tests that exercise SSL with other components of Mesos, such as the HTTP scheduler library, we need to use the setup teardown logic found in the fixture. Currently, the test fixtures have separate inheritance structures like this: where is a gtest class. The plan is the following: Change to inherit from . This will require moving the setup (generation of keys and certs) from to . At the same time, of the cleanup logic in the SSLTest will not be needed. Move the logic of generating keys certs into helpers, so that individual tests can call them when needed, much like . Write a child class of which has the same functionality as the existing , for use by the existing tests that rely on or the . Have inherit from (which might be renamed during the refactor). If Mesos is not compiled with , then could be 'd into any empty class. The resulting structure should be like:. The messages we pass between Mesos components are largely undocumented. See this .. Currently, the HTTP Scheduler library does not support SSL-enabled Mesos. (You can manually test this by spinning up an SSL-enabled master and attempt to run the event-call framework example against We need to add tests that check the HTTP Scheduler library against SSL-enabled Mesos: with required certifications, with without verification of certificates * with a custom certificate authority (CA) These options should be controlled by the same environment variables found on the . Note: This issue will be broken down into smaller sub-issues as bugs problems are discovered.. not set on tasks with. HTTP scheduler library does not gracefully parse invalid resource identifiers. If you pass a nonsense string for ""master"" into a framework using the HTTP scheduler library, the framework segfaults. For example, using the example frameworks: Results in: Results in. I am install Mesos on 4 servers which have very similar hardware and software After performing , , and some servers have completed successfully and other failed on test . Is there something I should check in this test?. With committed, the and endpoints should also take an input as an array. It is important to change this before maintenance primitives are released: Also, a minor change to the error message from these endpoints:. The previous changes (MESOS-3345) to support integer precision when converting JSON Protobuf did not support precision for unsigned integers between and . (There's some loss, but the conversion is still as good bad as it was with This problem is due to a limitation in the JSON parsing library we use (PicoJSON), which parses integers as . Some possible solutions or things to investigate: We can investigate using another parsing library. * If we want extra precision beyond 64 or 80 bits per double, one possibility is the . We'd still need to change the parsing library though.. We currently have some helper functionality for V1 API tests. This is copied in a few test files. Factor this out into a common place once the API is stabilized. We can also update the helpers in to support the V1 API. This would let us get ride of lines like: In favor of:. For the background, see the parent story . For the see the linked design document (below).. Add either log rotation or capped-size logging (for tasks). Tasks currently log their output stdout stderr) to files (the ""sandbox"") on an agent's disk. In some cases, the accumulation of these logs can completely fill up the agent's disk and thereby kill the task or machine. To prevent this, we should either implement a log rotation mechanism or capped-size logging. This would be used by utors to control the amount of logs they keep. Master agent logs will not be affected. We will first scope out several possible approaches for log in a design document (see ). Once an approach is chosen, this story will be broken down into some corresponding issues.. For , we added some protobufs to represent time with integer precision. However, this precision is not maintained through protobuf JSON conversion, because of how our JSON convert numbers to floating point. To maintain precision, we can try one of the following: Add logic to numbers without loss when possible. Update PicoJson and add a compiler flag, In all cases, we'll need to make sure that: The JSON decoder parses the integer without loss. * We have some unit tests for big (close to ) and small integers..

Persisted info is fetched from the registry when a master is elected or after failover. Currently, this process involves 3 steps: Start an operation to add the new master to the fetched registry. ** Change the ""Recovery"" test to include checks for the new object.. We need to implement the HTTP endpoints for Quota as outlined in the Design Doc: ( This also includes validating quota requests in terms of syntax correctness, updating Master bookkeeping structures, persisting quota requests in the .. In order to modify the maintenance schedule in the replicated registry, we will need Operations The operations will likely correspond to the HTTP API: Given a set of machines, verify then transition machines from Draining to Deactivated. * Given a set of machines, verify then transition machines from Deactivated to Normal. Remove affected machines from the schedule(s).. This is primarily a refactoring. The prototype for modifying the registry is currently: In order to support Maintenance schedules (possibly Quotas as well), there should be an alternate prototype for Maintenance. Something like: The existing should be refactored to allow for more than one key. If necessary, refactor existing operations defined in (AdminSlave, ReadminSlave, RemoveSlave).. In order to persist maintenance schedules across failovers of the master, the schedule information must be kept in the replicated registry. This means adding an additional message in the Registry protobuf in The status of each individual slave's maintenance will also be persisted in this way. Note: There can be multiple SlaveID's attached to a single hostname.. Replicated registry needs a representation of maintenance schedules. Maintenance information is not populated in case of failover. When a master starts up, or after a master has failed, it must re-populate maintenance information from the registry to the local state). Particularly, in should be changed to process maintenance information.. Slaves are not deactivated upon reaching a maintenance window. Master does not handle InverseOffers in the Accept call (Event Call API). Offers are currently sent from to framework via InverseOffers, which are roughly equivalent to negative Offers, can be sent in the same package. In Sent InverseOffers can be tracked in the master's local state: In One actor (master or allocator) should populate the new InverseOffers field. is where the and Offer object is constructed. In the allocator InverseOffers negative resources) allocation could be calculated in this method. Accept resource offer, start task. Check that are sent to the framework. Check that more are sent. Check that more are sent.. does not send InverseOffers to resources to be maintained. In the Event Call API, the Decline call is currently used by frameworks to reject resource offers. In the case of InverseOffers, the framework could give additional information to the operators and or allocator, as to why the InverseOffer is declined. Suppose a cluster running some consensus algorithm is given an InverseOffer on one of its nodes. It may decline saying ""Too few nodes"" (or, more verbosely, ""Specified InverseOffer would lower the number of active nodes below quorum""). This change requires the following changes: Change to either store the reason, or log it. Extend the interface in ** Add change the declineOffer method in. Decline call does not include an optional ""reason"", in the Event Call API. Resource offers do not contain given a maintenance schedule. The master will need to do a number of things to implement the maintenance primitives: For machines that have a maintenance window: For unused resources, offers must be augmented with an Filter them before sending them again. * For declined inverse offers, do something with the reason (store or log). Recover the maintenance information upon failover. Note: Some amount of this logic will need to be placed in the allocator.. To achieve for the maintenance primitives, we will need to add the maintenance information to the registry. The registry currently stores all of the slave information, which is quite large ( for 50,000 slaves from my testing), which results in a protobuf object that is extremely expensive to copy. As far as I can tell, reads writes to maintenance information is independent of reads writes to the existing 'registry' information. So there are two approach here: h4. Add maintenance information to 'maintenance' key: The advantage of this approach is that we don't further grow the large Registry object. This approach assumes that writes to 'maintenance' are independent of writes to the 'registry'. -If these writes are not independent, this approach requires that we add transactional support to the State -This approach requires adding compaction to This approach likely requires some refactoring to the Registrar. h4. Add maintenance information to 'registry' key: (This is the chosen The advantage of this approach is that it's the easiest to implement. This will further grow the single 'registry' object, but doesn't preclude it being split apart in the future. This approach may require using the diff support in LogStorage and or adding compression support to LogStorage snapshots to deal with the increased size of the registry.. Based on MESOS-1474, we'd like to provide an HTTP API on the master for the maintenance primitives in mesos. For the MVP, we'll want something like this for manipulating the schedule: (Note: The slashes in URLs might not be supported A schedule might look like: There should be firewall settings such that only those with access to master can use these endpoints.. In order to inform frameworks about upcoming maintenance on offered resources, per MESOS-1474, we'd like to add an optional information to offers:. InverseOffer was defined as part of the maintenance work in MESOS-1474, design doc here: This ticket is to capture the addition of the InverseOffer protobuf to the necessary API changes for Event Call and the language bindings will be tracked separately..

Dynamic reservations should be authorized with the of the reserving entity (framework or master). The idea is to introduce and into the ACL.

Make concurrent requests for the same URI wait for the one download. Different URIs from different CommandInfos can be downloaded concurrently.

We believe this will simplify the API to the caller, and will significantly reduce the length and complexity at the calling sites (<6 LOC against the current 20+).. Testing the new workflow. This is a simple test story to try out the new workflow. Unfortunately, testing and getting it to work seems to be something that actually does take up time, so I'm tracking this here.. We will probably move this functionality to a separate module - thanks everyone for your feedback!. See attached screenshot - the story is in the state, so it should now have a button, but it has a one instead. Also, when in the it has an button (I think) or something similar; also other states appear inconsistent. This Story is about first looking at the workflow; ensuring the stories and their status(es) are consistent; that button in the UI are consistently applied and then correct any issues that may have been identified. The assumption here is that the workflow is: and, at each stage, it can be moved ""back by one"" (, , ) and that, at any stage, it can be moved to (for whatever reason).. Add validation behavior to FlagsBase. In every ""launcher"" file (ie, those containing some variation on ) there is a minor variation on: As this is default behavior, and we've added support for the flag in the class, we should add this too there and remove it from everywhere else. Additionally, a recurring behavior is checking for the presence of a flag: or some variation thereof: we should add automatic validation for required flags during parsing. This follows the DRY principle.. Following from some email conversation, I'm reporting here a proposal to add to the PB: Regarding version - we have (apparently a generated file : which we could easily use in to assemble the version. The problem with string-based version is that it's virtually impossible to come up with anything that will allow to terminally decide if version-x < version-y is the very problem that was meant to deal with. Something like: and we build a full version by concatenating the fields, with the optional build: you get the idea :) This way, we use canonically the to decide ""precedence"" (and, ideally, ""distance"" too) but folks can add whichever decoration they choose to enrich the Mesos version number.. Incorrect URI scheme causes Slave to SegFault. Add ability to decode JSON serialized MasterInfo from ZK. Currently to discover the master a client needs the ZK node location and access to the MasterInfo protobuf so it can deserialize the binary blob in the node.

This ticket is an intermediate step: we add in the ability for the to ""understand"" JSON Protobuf serialized format; this makes it compatible with both earlier versions, as well a future one (most likely, ) that will write the information in JSON format..

229,mesos,xujyan,"Unmount irrelevant host mounts in the new container's mount namespace.. So far AppC store is read only and depends on out of band mechanisms to get the images. We need to design a way to support fetching in a native way. As commented on MESOS-2824: It's unacceptable to have either have: the first task that uses this image to be blocked for a long time to wait for the container image to be ready. The solution needs to enable the operator to prefetch a list of ""preferred images"" without introducing the above problems.. A few motivations: 1) Given the design in MESOS-3004 it became apparent that we need to support multiple images in a container and these images can be of different image types. (There are no sufficient reasons or major obstacles that force us not to allow it and it obviously gives the users more flexibility). 2) Also, even though we currently allow only one backend for each provisioner, when we update a running slave there can be multiple backends left in each container that we need to launch tasks with, or at least recover. We should evaluate in the future whether to support multiple backends and choose among them dynamically based on image 3) Since the rootfs' lifecycle tie with the running containers and should be cleaned up after containers die, it fits into the pattern of and we can manage them inside the work dir without needing to ask the operator to specify more flags.. Implement a 'read-only' AppC Image Store. It's going to be derived from this: (and other related patches) but in the initial 'read-only' version the store's content is prepared by mechanisms so the store component in Mesos only needs to provide access to images already in it and recover images upon slave restart. This greatly simplifies the initial version's responsibility and test cases. Features that fetch the images into the store will be added later and they will take into consideration its impact on task start latency and slave restart etc.. As I commented here: Currently is defined as the following message AppC In which the is a required field. When users specify the image in tasks they likely will not use an image id (much like when you use docker or rkt to launch containers, you often use or and seldom a SHA512 ID) and we should change it to be optional. The motivating scenario is that: if the frameworks in the Mesos use something like to run a task and defaults to , the operator can swap the latest version for all new tasks requesting . If they allow users to specify , they can swap the live version under the covers as well. This allows the operator to release important image updates security patches) and have it picked up by new tasks in the cluster without asking the users to update their job task configs..

To support this, we shall: Extend the Operation interface so that it supports a Quota accumulator (see Recover quotas from the registry on failover to the Masters struct; * Extend RegistrarTest with quota-specific tests. NOTE: Registry variable can be rather big for production clusters (see MESOS-2075). While it should be fine for MVP to add quota information to registry, we should consider storing Quota separately, as this does not need to be in sync with slaves update. However, currently adding more variable is not supported by the registrar. While the Agents are reregistering (note they may fail to do so), the information about what part of the quota is allocated is only partially available to the Master. In other words, the state of the quota allocation is reconstructed as Agents reregister. During this period, some roles may be under quota from the perspective of the newly elected Master. The same problem exists on the allocator side: it may think the cluster is under quota and may eagerly try to satisfy quotas before enough Agents reregister, which may result in resources being allocated to frameworks beyond their quota. To address this issue and also to avoid panicking and generating under quota alerts, the Master should give a certain amount of time for the majority 80%) of the Agents to reregister before reporting any quota status and notifying the allocator about granted quotas..

Provide an equivalent in SDK. Extensions should be able to import TopLevel parameters from other extensions. Allow config level components in the Extensions API. When an extension has several configuration models available, there's often the need to have operations, connection providers or even sources which can only function with a subset of those This is currently not possible. We need to be able to: The sources, providers and operations available to a configuration are those defined at its own level + the ones defined at the extension level Going back to the example above, if is only referenced by configuration A, it should be possible to write such operations depending on A exclusively, making it no longer necessary for A to share any kind of type abstraction with B or C. Consider the following code: If the paremeter had some specific optional value, it would make sense for the created there to be overriden. However, if it defaults to null, it's not from a UX perspective to force the user into implementing Initialisable and doing the there. That value should be respected when the optional is null.. Currently when creating an extension, the annotation is mandatory, we should specify at least the namespace of the extension. If the annotation is not present, this error is thrown diagnostic: error: xml model property cannot be null. Instead of creating a validator for avoiding this error, we must implement a default behaviour for the annotation when it is not present. The behavior should be that: 1) The annotation can be either completely absent or present but with all optional parameters 2) The namespace attribute will be derived from the extension name by transforming to lower case, removing all occurrences of the ""connector"" String and hyphenizing 3) The schemaLocation should default to where is replaced by the namespace value 4) The schemaVersion should default to the Major and minor components of the Semver extension version, without classifiers. For example: should translate to. If the annotation is not present, the extension should not fail.. Remove module from the Mule 4 project. Remove devkit-support module. The following are missing and should be added: Validate that all configuration models can be used with all operation models. This comes to the fact that an operation can require a connection type for which the available connection providers might be incompatible with certain configs Validate clashes on fields Validate that all connection providers have different names. Hint the user into using the annotation to customize the provider's names.. Implement connection validation policy on Ext-Api. Passing a JaxB annotated pojo to the HTTP listener response is throwing a transformer error. Should be able to fetch prototype by name without lifecycle applied. In most scenarios, when a prototype is lookup up by name, lifecycle should be applied to it before returning. There're some scenarios fetching a that will go into a which are not so and we need a way to specify that this case is different. The following method was applied to the to support such case:. Reverse the semmantics of MULE-8415. The flag introduced in MULE-8415 disables dependency injection for devkit components. We need it to be other way around. By default, Mule is not to inject into Devkit and the property is to be renamed to and only when set to true devkit will be considered into DI.. This issue is fixed by MULE-8501. Validate that Pojo attributes are not composites. When a pojo is used as a parameter in an Extension, XSD support is generated to allow users define the instance on the XML. However, this won't work if the object is a composite. The composite fields should be skipped when generating the XSD support.. Spike on on inferring extension version from project version. Currently, the annotation includes a version attribute which is used to specify an extension version. However, it's undesirable to have the need to upgrade the version of every extension each time that a new version is released. A mechanism should be defined for the extension version to be automatically inferred from the underlying $. There should still be a way to fix the extension version arbitrarily. Implement a solution to automatically infer supported schema versions for XML compatible extensions. Currently the ext-api is creating a new instance of the operation implementation for each event. That is very confortable for the user, but it has performance considerations associated to garbage collection and the new to perform dependency injection all the time. We need to move to a schema in which: The Class holding the method annotated with needs to have a constructor which receives a single argument which is the configuration to use. Failure to provide such a constructor which result in the application not starting This also means that it will no longer be valid to obtain things like the MuleEvent through a annotation, you have to receive it a method argument, which means that the invoker needs a refresh too.

Upgrade Saxon to. Upgrade Saxon in order to get fully compliant and basic support for XPath, XSLT and XQuery. When doing OAuth with Connectors created by DevKit it's possible to define a connector-ref attribute and reference the that will listen for the OAuth callbacks. This is the way in which current Devkit connectors allow support for https on the callback. This should integrate with the new connector in the following way: If no connector is specified, but the configuration flag is turned on, then we default to the old transport * If a connector-ref is specified, then it should show the same behaviour with either the new connector or the old transport. Add a system property named which forces a console appender if one is not already defined on the current log4j configuration. The purpose of this is to enable other products such as Studio to always have a predictable way to capture all the logs of the application regardless (and without tampering with) its configuration. This is something additive to the configuration already present for the application (if any). It doesn't altere the standard configuration selection nor log separation performed in standard mode. the property has precedence over this property. If it is specified, then all the logic described here will not be uted.. The following apache commons libraries can be upgraded. commons-dbcp * commons-net. VM fails in getSize() when log level DEBUG. log4j was release and it contains some fixes, some of which we requested. We should upgrade. We need to upgrade to log4j2 ir oder to leverage the performance improvements of asynchronous logging.. Remove unsued configuration builders. We have code to support creating a mule flow service using a jruby script, groovy or Guice. The actual creating of the script requires advance knowledge of mule internals and it's not useful. Nobody is using it and also we don't support it in our IDE. We should only keep the spring configuration builders. Database bulk operations don't work with objects that don't implement Collection. The update bulk operation of the database module fails with collections that implement Collection but not Iterable. This causes a problem with Connector Query results which are usually Iterable or Iterator to allow lazy loading results, yet not implementing the Collection interface.. Mule fails to start if has a persistent object store with stored events. Consider the attached application. The mule event is persisted successfully when entering the block but upon an unexpected restart of the mule instance, the message could not be de-serialized again and an error in the logger is displayed with the following line: ERROR Could not restore partition under directory This happens because when the object store is open, it tries to cache the keys. Because the MuleEvent has a reference to its owning flow construct, a circular reference is created since the deserialized event tries to fetch the flow construct which triggered its loading. Steps to reproduce: Run the attached app and an ActiveMQ instance. Stop activeMQ place a non-empty file in (you may configure a more convenient folder). stop mule start activemq start mule Observe the logger line Observe that the message that should have been recovered from the persistent object store is not delivered to the broker. Expected behavior: Persistent object store should lazily cache its entry upon its first use. Workaround: Temporal workaround until this gets fixed is to set the lazy-init property to true in the spring bean that creates the object store. This is already supported in the new Database connector by using the ute-ddl message processor. Simply adding a test case to test that scenario. xpath function should not have any side effects on the message. ObjectStore is not expiring entries. Even though it's true that the code is not using the API correctly, I see that the monitoring thread is still not starting.

HTTP Listener returning 500 instead of 400 on invalid Content-Type. It'd be good to be able to share a TLS context so that several shared listener configs can use the same one.

266,mule,alejandro.garcia,"The discussion for this feature appeared with the inheritance of metadata resolvers (from the Extension or the Operation class). What happens is that if you have an operation which doesn't need a dynamic resolver but the parent has one defined, it should be applied if the operation return type is a Map or Object. With that solution we avoid the need of an annotation. The other thing is that in SDK we want to be as restrictive as possible with the developer, and it may be a good idea to forbid operations which return type is Map and doesn't have a resolver assigned.. Enforce metadata dynamic output resolver for Map and Object. We need to define how metaData will be resolved as a service from Mule and how it will be related to the Extension and its model. When generating the XSD of an extension that has maps, the map generated is not taking into account the Value type, and it always generating an entry for the Object class. Check XSD attached, generated for the In the example, a child element is created for Object valueTypes, which doesn't make sense. Object should always be treated as expression or ref only. This implies that for ""onMap"" cases does not pickup the correct generic of map valueType.. Add support on the SDK for receiving MEL expressions without getting the string evaluated.

HTTP listener should ignore property as it is a header. is a header and therefore shouldn't really be used by HTTP listener if there is a property present in the outbound property scope to determine response streaming behaviour. Generally current behaviour is fine, but there is one case that is currently incorrect IMO. We shouldn't stream a String payload when the and outbound message properties are both present. AUTO Behaviour appears to be inconsistent with HTTP requestor because the presence of both headers results in no streaming with requestor, but streaming with listener*. dispose() should not be invoked if initialise() fails. At least thats how I believe it always worked. This change causes NPE's in dispose() in a lot of cases. Which results in much more verbose and confusing errores being logged..

Steps to reproduce (see attached app): 1) Send HTTP request to . 2) Check in the log the datatype of the message after transformer in the outbound property. Inbound properties copied to outbound properties not maintain their datatypes. When the Inbound properties are copied to outbound properties they should maintain their datatypes. Right now they are setted to the default message type (Encoding null, MimeType ). 1) Send HTTP request to . 2) In the first log you can check that the outbound property ""inboundProp"" has before the VM connector. 3) After the VM connector the ""inboundProp"" is copied from the to with """". Then you can check in the second logger that the Datatype of the ""inboundProp"" is set with encoding null, mimeType. Using an incorrect value in the encoding field doesn't throw an excpetion if you change the DataType to a valid value before returning it. When setting the encoding in payload, transformers, properties and variables with an incorrect value it is not validated. In the other hand the mimeType throws an exception. I think that the encoding should have the same behaviour. When you set the property ""ContentType"" it let you use any value in both mimeType and encoding. But maybe in the content type situation is the desired behaviour. Steps to reproduce (see attached app): Set Payload: 1) Send HTTP request to : There the first set payload set the encoding with an invalid value but as then there is another set payload that set the encoding to a valid encoding there is not exception. 2) Send HTTP request to : Here the Set Payload set an invalid encoding value and it throws Properties: 1) Send HTTP request to : 2) Set property sets the encoding with a wrong value.

279,mule,dpelaez,"OAuth2 Refresh token logic fails after restart for preexistent connection. This issue is related to the problem encountered in JIRA MULE-8277. After restarting an application that uses the Box Connector, the first time a box request is made with a preexisting Box connection, that has an expired access token in its OAuthState, a refresh token process is triggered that does not attempt to save the refresh and access token obtained from box in the connector's ObjectStore. The Box connector postAuthorize method invokes one of the connector's processors in order to retrieve the id of the user after the OAuth2 dance for identification purposes. That request within the postAuthorize triggers the first refresh token process for the connector on its first use after restart. The way to reproduce the issue would be: - Run a mule application on mule with the Box Connector and a persistent Objectstore for it - Do the OAuth dance with a Box user using the authorize - Wait until the Box access token expires or modify it in the OAuthState saved in the Objectstore to make it invalid - Restart the mule application and attempt to run a Box like twice. (The first attempt should refresh but not save and the second should fail to refresh). When a MEL expression is set in the config-ref of a Salesforce Connector call and the object-store has no OAuthState stored for a user, the operation fails for that user with a with the following message. I believe the issue can be found in the following method: line 97. moduleObject is cast to without verifying if it is a String. The method findOrCreate does verify that in line 174..

307,nexus,plynch,"add log message if the data directory bundle cache contents are updated with new bundles. We are asking persons to install a patched osgi bundle and either delete the data cache directory or add a clean cache file. Then we may get a response the patch didn't work. We are left wondering if there could have been a mistake removing the cache directory but we have no log message to verify. One might get confused about where the data directory is because there also may be a data directory in the install directory as well. h3. Expected - a single log line at INFO on Nexus startup that summarizes that the cache directory was updated with bundles. RedHat docker push HTTP PUT uploads tar content instead of gzip and triggers 400. These commands can trigger Nexus to return a HTTP 400 response while reading already stored docker blob data. docker import docker tag docker push To review, Docker Client is submitting a JSON payload as part of PATCH requests that Nexus stores into blobs - at the end of all the chunked uploads, the docker client tries to end the upload with a HTTP PUT request. The PUT request of zero (0) content fails when the blob data is read from disk on the Nexus side. Nexus is working correctly with docker client using the same commands. Also Nexus 3 m7 and m6 was working with docker client with the same commands. Nexus was upgraded from a Nexus 3 M7 data directory. Redhat (OpenShift owner) is requiring the version of docker as part of the OpenShift platform. Docker requests fail with this pattern: - bakersi ""PATCH 202 0 12166 - bakersi ""PUT 400 192 564 Notice it is the PUT that is trying to complete the upload and sending 0 content which fails. A closer look at the stack trace tells us that Nexus fails when it tries to parse the content already stored inside uploaded blobs. So in some way nexus should try to report more precisely the actual problem or prevent getting into this state in the first place. h3. Workaround At least one of: - upgrade to a newer version of docker - - upgrade to a newer release version of Nexus that contains the fix. Generating support zip with configuration requires access to Nexus is tryiing to contact which is the main Eclipse web site. With external internet access blocked, Support zip generation (with configuration) fails with the following: h3. Expected - when generating a support zip, generation must not fail if external network access is not available - do NOT attempt any external network access when generating support zip. prevents installing gems when Nexus is running on Windows. improve logging when a retry is made in response to remote socket exceptions. REST client does not properly handle packaging parameter. Per NEXUS-4115, Nexus needs to allow case insensitive userid matching. There is a bug in nexus 3 LDAP user role mapping where this fails. Create an LDAP configuration as in the attached screenshots and map an LDAP user with 'test0002' user id. Assign the user the nx-admin role. You can successfully authenticate with this user as expected with , , or , however the roles are not mapped correctly unless you use the exact case userid that was mapped `test0002`. This results in being able to signin into the UI using any case, but not seeing the Administration cog or getting any admin privileges unless using an exact case match to . h3. Expected Correctly map all roles to a successfully authenticated user.. Tar does not contains rebuilding metadata for some npm packages. I have a pair of npm repository. One of them is a proxy repo to Other is a hosted repo, that is a mirror of the first. Artifacts from first repo is copying to the second. And than I build metadata on second hosted repository I see error, that some artifact Tar does not contains (see attach) What else, if I unpack a pair of artifact, I can see that they have different structures. - I can see on hosted repository, - I couldn't see and have error INFO - - Failed to extract or malformed from. Nexus had a single log line you could grep for Nexus startup AND determine the edition being started. OSS PRO Now the edition is no longer present and there is no simple way to determine which edition of Nexus the log is from. In both editions print this: h3. Expected Support staff need a way to quickly determine the edition being used only based on a single line of the log file. When this is especially important is during startup where errors may prevent getting a complete support bundle. h3. Workarounds - look at the plugins being loaded ( one per plugin) - from the reduced number of these log lines, one can guess that OSS is being used. - grep for and look at the app directory - the path printed at that line may include something like instead of h3. Other Ideas If the new line format must be kept, add a new log line with the text ""Nexus Pro"" so that our old method of grepping for edition can work.. UI javascript files are not. licensing UI should show distinction between recent connections and total licensed users. expire cache task on rubygems repositories may lead to api performance degradation. URL in proxied yum metadata files is not rewritten. h3. Reproduce Configure the following: rubygems-group - rubygems-proxy ( - ) rubygems-proxy is configured with Artifact Max Age: -1 Item Max Age: 1440 Configure logger at DEBUG level. Request a gem file through the group found on curl -u -o dev null -v This should return 200 response with correct content, and nexus should go remote since it does not have it cached yet. Confirm the file is now cached at Make the same request again. Nexus goes remote again for the same file. h3. Expected Since Artifact Max Age is -1, and the gem is already cached, Nexus should not go remote again until the actual gem file itself is no longer in the proxy repository cache or the max age for the specific gem is expired. Nexus should always check local first and serve it if present in storage. Once found, it should not continue to check any other member repositories of a group for the same gem. Make sure Artifact Max Age works when the proxy is accessed directly also, or there is an equivalent request which requires resolution of the specific gem file requested.. The Nexus Basic Auth realm name changed in version due to unintended branding changes. This could affect some use cases where the exact name of the realm was depended on, so we restored the original name to ""Sonatype Nexus Repository Manager"" Related issue:. revert Basic auth realm name change introduced in. h3. Problem If a user is not granted the Staging: Drop Repository privilege, they can still drop a repository upon release of that repository using the resource. h3. Reproduce Configure a user `sonatype` with UI Basic and a custom staging role: The user can login to the UI and view the staging repository list. The Drop button is disabled, implying they do not have the drop permission. However the Release button is not disabled as expected. The Release confirmation dialog includes a checkmark to Automatically Drop a repository upon release. When selected, the repository is dropped upon release, despite the user not having Staging: Drop Repository privilege. h3. Expected The bulk promote resource should only perform the release if the drop checkbox is not selected ( payload implies do not drop) when the user does not have permission to drop a repository. The UI should display a permission error. Keep in mind the maven staging plugin also uses this resource.. all proxied repository items should have ""remoteUrl"" attribute set. If you configure a port on a docker repository, you can also access the rest of Nexus through this port, including the UI. You can also configure the port to be the same as an existing connector defined manually in You cannot configure the port to be the same as another docker repository connector. Regardless, this is much more access than a docker specific repository port implies. Suggest we limit accessible URLs through a docker repository port to only those known to map correctly to docker repositories. Alternately, do we have a use case for allowing to use the same port as one configured in the jetty configuration files manually? The only benefit might be that one might want to reduce the ports to be managed through firewalls. However does this lead to potential exposure to URL conflicts with other parts of Nexus?. installing gems with long dependency chains can trigger IOException File name too long. Using bundler in particular, installing a gem through a rubygems proxy repository in Nexus can cause Nexus to return a 404 response and print File name too long in the logs.. allow setting for LDAP connections. At Under the valid names section: So Nexus needs to support package names like this when requested. The rule: ""package name must not contain any characters (since name ends up being part of a URL)"". valid npm package names not unescaped properly. deadlock between mergeropo and staging promotion. unable to start nexus when is set. help text in routing rules is wrong. remove codehaus snapshots from default configuration. orientdb may not fully recover from a restore process due to Class 'OUSER' was not found in current database. Yum updates to build promotion repositories are not propagated to their parent group repositories. please confirm - are you or are you not seeing this daily on Shall I delete your comment that you are seeing this daily?. outbound http connections may be immediately closed on 304 response with ETAG instead of pooled. archived name format should be more easily recognized as a log file. Our request logs log by default using the 'common' pattern: The field prints the response time instant. Example: - - ""GET 404 657 When correlating when the request is first received ( useful when coordinating requests with builds or other external scheduled jobs, it would be helpful to determine the elapsed time of the request from the request logs. This can be accomplished by using this pattern in We should adjust the default request log pattern to include elapsed time.. releasing a yum enabled staging repository overwrites yum metadata in release repository. outbound ssl sockets do not timeout if the remote does not respond. Bad things can sometimes happen during a Nexus shutdown process. Usually Nexus is restarted soon after. A support zip includes the Nexus intialization time start time. However if something bad happens during shutdown, it is sometimes useful from examining log files to know how long Nexus had been running just before the shutdown. These messages are currently printed on shutdown start: This is a request that as early as possible ( perhaps as part of the rather generic ""Destroying"" message ), Nexus also print a log line on shutdown initialization which indicates the total 'uptime' Nexus had before being asked to shutdown. Something like: ""uptime 11 days 12 hours 13 seconds"". This way, we know what log files to look at for the last Nexus startup before shutdown.. improve robustness to orientdb shutdown after stopping the store. The attached log shows a graceful shutdown on Windows and a message about a corrupt OrientDB because the file was zero bytes. There's a potential flaw in the NPM shutdown logic where an exception while stopping the store means we don't go on and cleanly shutdown OrientDB: This doesn't explain why the state transition failed ( in the attached log ), but adding a block here should avoid leaving OrientDB in an odd state when it does happen.. logger prints useful outbound request information in a compact format. One useful addition to the log message would be the response http status code. This can help detect remote problems more quickly, and can help infer what why Nexus responded to an inbound request. Additionally, the npm plugin should log outbound requests in the same format as other proxy repositories do.. logger should include http response status and have consistent format. can have performance implications with large numbers of repositories. outreach does not detect http global configuration changes. add useful logging for resource username mismatch. gradle sample project uses an obsolete version of the. On every npm proxy repository cache expiry, when the remote is checked for metadata updates, then the npm Orient DB database file file grows by a large unexpected amount. In theory I would expect no need to store this much new data in the database for something that did not really change. Reproduce using 1. create npm proxy repo to 2. Set all cache settings to 1 minute ( for testing purposes ). Save. These will display as 1,0,0,1 ( UI bug, not the issue ) 3. note size: mine is 65k 4. request and get 200 response 5. note size: mine becomes 449K 6. wait more than 1 minute for cache expiry. Set logger to DEBUG. 7. request express again - verify 304 not modified response from remote, note size increase - now size is: 833K 8. repeat - for every cache expiry, will grow over 400 k.. improve snapshot remover tasks performance by reducing potential i o. 1. When processing GAV that contains multiple timestamped pom files, and the remove if released option is true, then make sure we only check for release once, not once per every timestamp snapshot. This reduces the I O for the task when the remove if released option is checked ( true ) . 2. Do not include signature or hash files when checking for the oldest accessed snapshot last requested timestamp. Given each artifact can have upwords of 5 total of these , .sha1 and .md5 ) and typically always two ( .sha1, .md5 ), this can reduce I O reading attributes files by a minimum of 66%. This is always a benefit to the task because this task always tries to calculate the days since any snapshot was last requested. It does this by reading attributes files off disk. Avoiding the above files means attributes for these files does not need to be read off disk. 3. When determining the most recent last requested time for the snapshots in the same build number, avoid iterating over the entire GAV collection of files for each artifact to check. By caching the last requested timestamps in the main processing loop, and determining the most recent last requested date on the fly, we can avoid iterating over the entire collection again for each file, when needing to find the most recent last requested for similar snapshots. This has significant performance benefits for the task.. See video: Note I am not clicking anything other than the Create Role button. Menu is just hiding on it's own before I can click anything.. mime detection may not cache properly for specific request paths. non proxy hosts tooltip suggests a misleading syntax. At the moment we always merge the downloaded package root with previously cached content. This can end up leaving bad entries in the cache even after they have been removed from the upstream proxy. The most likely reason package versions were removed from the remote is due to the package author them. End users should examine the associated package SCM repository commit history to look for a note of such an action. NEXUS-8625 also describes another scenario where Nexus can end up with bad metadata. Expected: Replace the cached metadata content with the new downloaded content.. Our current npm repository behaviour: 1. Request a package tgz through a proxy repository that exists in the remote. 404 not found 2. Request the metadata for that package. 200 response and package url in step 1 says to get it from Nexus 3. Try to get the package again from Nexus - still 404, cached not found. Expected: Nexus should try to be more forgiving when a package file is requested before metadata.. prevent when expiring not found cache and updating package metadata at the same time for a npm repository. The npm database can get in a state where expiring the not found cache on an npm repository can trigger an if package metadata is updated at the same time by another thread. The other thread would typically be a get or PUT request for an npm package. Expected: do better preventing this commonly reproducible concurrency issue. expire cache task on npm group repositories should not abort when there is a problem processing member repositories. ExpireCacheTask on an npm group repository will abort if there is a problem processing a member repository. Expected: The task should not abort. The problem should be logged and the task should continue processing as many records member repositories as possible. For an example problem, see NEXUS-8568.. Under certain startup conditions, Nexus staging configuration validation can orphan staging repositories such that they are no longer visible in the Nexus Staging Repositories UI. The repository storage directory will still exist for the repository, and the orphaned staging repository(s) will still be visible via Repositories - Nexus Managed Repositories list. Example log excerpts on startup where staging validation removed a staging repository because it was not yet added to the internal registry of repositories: h4. Symptoms After a Nexus restart, some staging repositories are no longer visible in the staging repositories list. Log messages similar to this will be present in - Validation warning: o repositories - Staging Repository is not a valid repository, removing from configuration. h4. Workaround There is no workaround to prevent this race condition. h4. How to Recover Orphaned Repositories. Repositories can be recovered by Sonatype Support. Affected users should open a support ticket at along with a Nexus support bundle.. not found cache should be expired for packages with implied references from updated package metadata. deprecate and disable the ""download nuget feed"" scheduled task. Start nx3 for the first time. empty storage. Add an HTTP proxy to Nexus. Trust the SSL certificate my proxy serves using the SSL Certificates UI ( this works fine and goes through proxy) GET Request is 200 and works, but request does not go through proxy server tested. nexus pro log may report nexus as unlicensed on startup even when it is. make it easier to find the nexus software license. It would be useful to get ?describe output as JSON in addition to HTML. - scripting can parse JSON much more easily than html - when requesting ?describe output from an end user for asking the user to login to UI, and then using same browser session to request ?describe output is extra work to do and explain. In some cases, the user may not even be able to access the UI due to security restrictions - it is much simpler to visually grok a JSON response on the cmd line - a cmd line response as JSON can be more easily piped into JSON parsing tools to isolate specific data Proposed Criteria: - if the user agent implies a web browser is being used, return html, otherwise return JSON with the appropriate Content-Type header - if the request Accept header explicitly requests either JSON or HTML, return it as requested - the data (model) returned for both content types should be identical - JSON pretty printed by default is preferable, but not absolutely required initially if it impacts the implementation significantly. Connection leak in Browse Remote when content encoding is gzip. There is a connection leak triggered when using the Browse Remote feature. h4. Symptoms Logs contain these types of messages: bq. WARN - - Failed to get directory listing content bq. Timeout waiting for connection from pool h4. Cause Under normal circumstances the leak is handled gracefully by GC and HttpClient. Still, in case when remote uses gzip and or chunked transfer encoding, the connections are NOT reused even after longer period, leading to connection pool depletion. h5. Original reporter's description: When I'm browsing a remote maven repository in after maybe steps through the remote repository tree, I get an infinitly spinning cirle. Refresh doesn't work either. The only way to continue browsing the repository is to restart Nexus. This seems to impede all communication with the remote repository. Downloading a file that has not yet been cached locally doesn't work either in this state. h4. Workaround For immediate mitigation a Nexus restart is required to free the leaking connections. For temporary mitigation until you upgrade to a fixed Nexus version, install the version specific patched jars attached to this issue.. Create a Maven 2 proxy repository to called `Yum-Newrelic` a request at this path is uting ( and ultimately returns with 302 or 404 ): before this request ends, a request at these paths at the same time fail or throw errors:. concurrent request paths cause during population of not found cache. support zip generation fails if system has mounted clearcase volumes. The forgot feature rest resource ( ) of Nexus can cause performance issues against an external realm. We should consider options such as: - optimizing the generic queries that the resource performs for external users - provide a configurable way to disable the feature - consider removing the feature entirely if that is easier - removing the Forgot Username and Forgot Password resource privs from the built in anonymous role. Acceptance Criteria: - Remove Forgot feature from UI (just remove the js code). forgot password feature performs badly with external realms. Create a npm hosted repo with id 'npm-hosted'. Publish one package into it. Hit the - all resource for this repo. Verify the published package metadata. Delete the entire npm hosted repo using the repository Delete button. Create another npm hosted repo with the same id. Hit the - all resource for this repo again - you still get metadata about the first repo even though the new repo contains nothing. Similar: delete all the content from a hosted npm repo but leave the repo itself. Nexus still serves metadata about packages which do not exist. Expire cache on the hosted repo does not help.. Tried to run rebuild hosted npm metadata task ( new in ) against about 500MB of tgz packages from the strongloop registry. Had several messages of concern - unsure as to the overall seriousness of each of these:. Enable User Token and the Protect Content feature. When a request is made to a content path with valid credentials that are not Nexus user token credentials, Nexus responds with 401, but no entity explaining why. Problems: - the end user is confused, because they know they have entered technically valid organization credentials. - the Nexus admin is confused because they either have forgotten about or were not the ones who setup the Protect Content feature, or just assume protecting content is a good idea, so leave the box enabled. - the Protect Content feature is valuable, but it is a rather odd special case that affects all realms in Nexus because of the special Token it creates internally, so an administrator is not reminded it may be in play because it is not near where all the other realms are configured - a Nexus admin must enable DEBUG and TRACE logs to see why there was a 401, assuming they can even understand what loggers to enable and what to look for Improvement: Simple continue to respond with 401, but include a simple message body explaining the reasoning - that user token credentials are being enforced in Nexus. In this way a simple test using curl that gets 401 response will help the admin, end user or Sonatype Support in quickly identifying the problem.. maven site deployments with .. in paths fail. support proxying. resuming downloads for unsatisfiable Range should respond with 416 or 200 instead of 206. Currently a request to logout with a valid session cookie, will delete the server side session in Nexus, so that the originally sent session cookie value is no longer valid in the browser. However the response that comes back should ( but does not ) ask the user-agent to delete expire the existing session cookie, so that it does not bother trying to send it again. We should make logout return a Set-Cookie header as expected that forces delete expiry of the session cookie.. should ask the user-agent to delete the session cookie. allow nexus to load outreach content by and user. Secure flag should be set on Set-Cookie values dynamically based on if the inbound request is reported as secure by the container hosting Nexus, instead of using the configurable option provided by NEXUS-7800. Configure repos: nuget-group ( ) Delete the Nexus anonymous user. Do not configure Nuget API key realm. Make the following request with Nexus wget admin -S by design, wget does not use pre-emptive auth and makes two requests, the first responds with 401 and headers and the second sends your credentials in response. does not print the authenticated user on the second request. - - ""GET 401 0 - - ""GET 404 388 Note: the 404 in this case was because I had an http proxy server configured in Nexus returning 404 for the outbound request. This should normally return 200 and not related to this problem. Seems like the security filter change in NEXUS-7785 where the logging was added is not being picked up for some reason.. As a Nexus administrator I want a supported procedure to rebuild the npm metadata from existing npm repository storage, particularly from hosted repositories. This is useful for rebuilding metadata from rsynced npm storage in a failover instance and as a database corruption recovery tool.. provide a scheduled task to rebuild the npm metadata from storage data for hosted repositories. non-snapshot versions containing SNAPSHOT can bypass a release repository Deployment Policy. npm groups should merge versions of the same package in different members. in pom validator staging rule. capture generation time in analytics event-zip as reference. limit size of analytics event zip files at creation and submission. downloading specific versions of NuGet packages via Visual Studio package manager console fails. Upgrade to Apache Tika for better mime detection. The clm server password is not removed from the file in a generated support zip:. npm install cmd can trigger nexus NPE and 500 status when remote returns non-standard fields and stub attachments. Configure proxy to Configure proxy server in nexus. Make these requests: curl -s -v -4 gets 404 curl -s -v -4 gets 200 but nexus sends TWO requests to remote - see NEXUS-7616 ( this creates a file at ) cat bower jvm 1 INFO admin - Applying Nexus Configuration due to changes in made by jvm 1 INFO admin - The Remote URL of repository ""npmjs"" (id npmjs) has been changed, expiring its caches. jvm 1 INFO admin - Scheduled task started :: Expiring caches for repository npmjs from path null and below. jvm 1 INFO admin - Scheduled task finished :: Expiring caches for repository npmjs from path null and below.

In NEXUS-5526, a change was made to allow system properties to be set on the HTTP Client embedded within Nexus. We have since regressed back to not allowing this: And the attempt to backout changes did not restore use of the System connection factory method: In Nexus we started including httpclient into Nexus. - however in our regression prevents setting protocols and ciphers on outbound connections from being an option for end users. So two problems: - it seems honouring system properties that influence the outbound http connections - we don't expose a way to set https protocols and ciphers preferences on Nexus outbound connections ( ) Expected - make Nexus use the system socket factories provided by http client, so that standard system properties can influence outbound connections. allow configuring and on Nexus outbound HTTP client connections. Show ""Browse Storage"", ""Browse Remote"", ""Mirrors"", in ""Summary"" tab based on repository type. h3. Browse Remote Browse Remote parses remote HTML directory lists. Unless the remote publishes a parseable HTML directory listing, Browse Remote cannot work. Browse Remote should only be visible for Maven 1, Maven 2, P2, OBR repository types. ( although as stated, if remote is not publishing something parseable, still may not work ) h3. Browse Storage Show ""Browse Storage"" only for 'maven1', 'maven2', 'nugett', 'obr', 'p2', 'site' In the case of P2 proxy repo, the UI may timeout requesting the local storage contents, as the local storage triggers generating of a large which can take greater than the 60 second default UI timeout to render. h3.

If I am a savvy user and am using over HTTPS, and issue a metadata request like this one: It will tell me to get the tarball over HTTP. What is the point of HTTPS then? As I checked, both HTTP and HTTPS URLs works for tarball. NPM registry issue was told to close it, then we filed was told to close it, then we to get some traction.. comma in group membership attribute value breaks static LDAP group mapping. maven staging plugin -1 on release using Java 8. and master branches have been updated A note that we are justifying this change because the NuGet features have moved into OSS recently We expect the host resources available to OSS users to be similar to pro users now as well. Specifically the heap sizes are changed as follows in. Configure ldap config to a valid server with 5000 users. Open users management. Change the source to LDAP. Nexus now makes 5000+ group member queries and tries to load 5000 records into the Nexus UI. More than likely Nexus UI will timeout and not render anything - meanwhile the queries are happily proceeding as requested in the backend. This will either crash LDAP, crash Nexus or crash the browser.. prevent from creating sqlite rpm metadata. NEXUS-6189 introduced not returning headers for 401 web browser content responses. This is non-standard behaviour. A customer wants to upgrade to latest Nexus, and when they did, this broke some internal tooling that relied on Disabling the browser detector is not a good long term solution for them because their internal tool is already deployed to production. The request is to add some way to specify a user agent string that can always be treated as a non-browser, and therefore return the default authenticate headers.. Summary: - TMPDIR environment variable should be set to absolute value when YUM command line is forked environment*. Yum createrepo and mergerepo tools seem to respect the TMPDIR environment variable. Launch Nexus with TMPDIR environment variable not set but system property set in property. When a YUM metadata task is forked, the forked yum tooling can potentially choose a different tmp dir than what is set as. In one case this caused a no space left on device error when metadata was being generated for a large yum repo because var tmp was filling up. Additionally, our YUM code makes assumptions about the tmp dir being used by YUM, which could conflict with the tmp dir specified by TMPDIR env variable.. . start (no output to console - did it start?) . start (no output to console about already running container) now you have two containers running and no feedback about this . stop (no output anything was stopped) You still have one container running. Continue stopping by running . stop - sometimes the script does detect the other containers running, sometimes it prints Can't connect to the container. The container is not running. when one is Same thing happens using . nexus script directly. Expected: - prevent starting multiple containers - properly detect running containers - always provide feedback to console about what we thought happened - do we even need all these individual control scripts exposed to user? what about just having like before. running . start n times, starts the container n times. Yum metadata for proxy repositories should refer to the URL of the source Nexus instance. add more robust proxy repository URL validation. upgrade from previously upgraded OSS to Pro ldap configuration can fail subsequent upgrades. LDAP OSS to Pro upgrade bug, multiple configuration fields are not migrated. allow direct request for NuGet artifact through proxy repository if artifact is not already cached in the local feed. Nuget: return 403 with reason instead of 404 when redirection fails through a proxy server. Given an org configures an http proxy server to access certain hosts only And Nexus is configured with this http proxy server And GET requests to a nuget proxy repository hosted in Nexus have to follow a redirect to a different host than the host they proxy in order to download an artifact When the artifact is downloaded through Nexus and the http proxy server responds with 403 because access to that host is not allowed Then Nexus should respond to the original request with 403 And the response should include the possible reason of the 403 ( source proxy server was used, the redirected to host used and that the routing through it failed with 403) Nexus currently responds with 404 and no reason to the NuGet client. This leads a Nexus admin to turn on Nexus DEBUG logging to see redirection failure instead of client user knowing they need to configure the Nexus HTTP proxy server to allow certain hosts.. Crowd plugin that is not configured logs when viewing security roles. CLM application drop down when editing a staging profile has some confusing items. - it asks to choose ""(none)"" when it is not even an option if CLM is not configured. - it asks to ""select an application"" when one can't be selected since CLM is not configured, OR the license prevents display of an app OR CLM user does not have permissions to the app.. upgrade to HTTP client. Smart Proxy download immediately option for checksum updates sends duplicate download requests for main artifact. OBR virtual repository metadata update fails when triggered by smart proxy download immediately. uncompressed archives with HTML file as an entry can be rejected by file content validation. Archive browser doesn't work for NuGet .nupkg packages. ERROR log message from M2Repository - does not include root cause throwable. Nexus logs may contain an ERROR log message similar to the following ( not specific to this particular artifact ): ERROR anonymous - Got in proxy repository ""Atlassian"" while caching retrieved artifact got from URL will attempt next mirror, cause: Cause: Expected: This log message should include a stack trace to better understand what led to this problem.. A comment with security level 'Developers' was removed.. inbound request URL syntax validity should be checked and fail fast. Inbound request URLs that contain certain invalid characters may bypass basic syntax checking and cause Nexus to perform more internal work then necessary. This can also cause Nexus to report noisy WARN messages in the logs. Expected: Nexus should perform URL syntax validation as early as possible and fail with simple log messages instead of verbose WARN when a URL is syntactically invalid. The HTTP response should return a 400 status in this case.. Enter as the search term for the key and value fields in metadata search. You get an ugly error dialog in In the error dialog is less ugly although the error message could be improved to be less technical. The 'home page' link in the error dialog is broken. ( 404). I tracked this down to cookies do not typically set the port. So per RFC can be sent to a different server as long as the host name is the same. Setting the port in the cookie may cause other issues with browsers (and how does this play with firewalls and proxies) One simple solution is to make the cookie name configurable. If we ever switch to shiro-guice (which will remove a bunch of other code) we could easily the cookie name. Or if we are going to keep our boiler plate code, we could configure the cookie name in to call Original Setup: I started two nexus pro instances locally. Nexus A - - publisher Nexus B - - subscriber Established a Smart Proxy trust between A and B. Created repo on Nexus B proxied to Nexus A Besides logging into the UI only a few times I noticed the following after a short while in the Nexus B logs: jvm 1 INFO - - Validating all active jvm 1 INFO - - Finished session validation. sessions were stopped. Nexus A seemed to have 169 sessions cleaned up. How is it that 274 sessions were created? Are these being created by smart proxy?. Enhancement: Tie OData to Lucene index (for performance). Create a Nuget Repo Group containing one each of Nuget Proxy, hosted, virtual repos. Create an Expire Repository Caches task. Notice that the NuGet proxy and Nuget Hosted Repos are available to select in the task configuration, however NuGet Group is not. Compare this with the fact a Maven 2 Group Repo can be selected for this task.. Enhancement: Browse Index tab for NuGet repos. Given that a user can browse an Index of Maven artifacts via the Browse Index tab, and given oData information may be made indexable with lucene in Nexus UI, it may be suitable to support a Browse Index view of nupkg artifacts from within the Nexus UI. The usefulness of this may be in question for NuGet repos however since developers will typically use NuGet Package Explorer to 'explore' nupkg artifacts.. Not having JCE cause problems with some installation We should detect if it is installed, and if it is installed, log the fact at INFO. Apparently calling this will work for this purpose: It will return 128 if no JCE is installed, 2147483647 if it is.. Print message in log if high-strength JCE is installed. If yum metadata generation fails the output of the command should always be logged. The support tools tab does not show how to contact support. The edition should have a link to the ""create ticket"" link in the support site (. Add end-user instructions for support ticket creation in Support Tools UI. nuget local repos feeds should support nuspec dependency optional attribute. Nuspec defines an optional attribute as of version When uploading a nupkg with a nuspec containing this attribute, Nexus does not expose the framework bits in the feed element, therefore . In contrast, . Example: 1) Download a nupkg which specifies dependencies with Results in a file called 1) Boot nexus Pro 2) Add a local repo of Nuget type 3) Using the artifact upload tab, upload the nuget artifact into the local nuget repo. 4) Perform a search against that local nuget repo for the uploaded artifact. The feed entry returned will not contain the string inside the dependency element. Compare this with a proxy Nuget repo of the official feed: 1) in nexus, add a proxy repo against 2) wait for the download nuget index task to complete ( approx 5-6 minutes ) 3) Perform a search against that proxy nuget repo for the same artifact. The feed entry returned will contain the string inside the dependency element. Attached files contain the detailed differences: curl -v "" -o -u curl -v "" -o. Starting in Nexus automatic upgrade of versions of Nexus older than are no longer supported. Upgrades to Nexus or newer must first upgrade to the latest version first, then upgrade to the latest version.. ui dialogs display literal html tags. make a UI request to Nexus that will timeout. the simplest is start nexus, login, shutdown nexus and make another ui request. You see a dialog that states the request timed out ( as expected ) but the message starts with '' This is just one example. Other dialogs have the same escaping problem.. improve Remove Releases from Repository task performance. As said in summary. When first scheduled, we had an oom exception. So we increased the max memory to 1 GiB. After that we had no more oom issues. The task ran for 147h 43m 57s and finished successfully. During this time he cleaned up 8270 releases (as derived from the log entries ""Recreating Maven2 metadata in repository ID 'releases' from Disk space went from 134GiB down to 75GiB. While it was successfull I think this is incredibly slow. The fix might be similar to the one from issue NEXUS-4640. Fix: A new task option is added to make the task perform better.. Seeing this a lot in customer logs. Can we prevent this huge stack? Looks like request was ending in 4xx error and failed to write the template. Hopefully it cleans up after. Browse remote tab is visible for Nuget repos but should not be. To minimize any potential problems fronting nexus with Apache mod proxy or other reverse proxies using the headers, we should configure Jetty to acknowledge and respect any X-Forwarded headers by default. See Jetty Logic here: See Jetty Docs describing how to front Jetty with reverse proxy SSL: Related forum post: We should also update the book to mention how to set the header in httpd as well.. Role ID field should not appear editable after save of External Role Mapping. DN values containing "","" (comma) can result in improperly escaped LDAP filters. improve SNAPSHOT version detection when deploying release artifact to SNAPSHOT repository. Nexus upgrade does not properly back up changed configuration files.. Regression: Failed. Revert: Link to nexus book logging section in the logger UI. When setting ""Publish URL"" to false, prevent repo Summary tab from displaying 'undefined' distribution management section. Nexus is generating invalid at GA level. in your local hosted releases repo create the following paths: start Nexus if you haven't already. Login as admin. Browse releases repo local storage. You should see the file paths above. right click on each one and upon request. Also notice the '(Not Found)' text appended to tree paths when selected in the tree. See attached video for overview. behaved slightly different, finding more paths, but also returning server error for the one with percent sign, where simply says Not Found.. I tried adding a unit test to in ldap-common module. Since all the unit test methods are using Junit 4x annotations I assumed these were being used to run the tests. It turns out that this is not forced ( it used to be afaik ) and instead Junit delegates to instead since in above case depends on from which extends PlexusTestCase which finally extends Junit 3x TestCase. Surefire decides that Junit 3 runer must be used then. This leads to confusion in writing additional tests and who knows if some test methods are not being run because they are not named properly.

No roles found for user: cstamas Method) at Method) at. hanging test using Jetty 6x windows. Noticed was hanging for 11 hours and took a thread dump of the stuck surefire process.. Only proxy repositories should participate in not found cache (NFC) to improve performance. We should log this at DEBUG:. If a capability is created and then encounters a configuration error, the description will contain the word FAILED: followed by the class name of the see NXCM-3681 ) When trying to delete the capability you will be asked for confirmation with a message such as ""Delete the ""FAILED: capability?"" It would be more logical to use the capability type instead of description here, or neither of these. See attached screenshot for an example of how this looks.. Attributes Upgrader logs duplicate stack trace when a file is not found and stops. Index: 2, Size: 0 editing group membership. This was seen running the load test described in NEXUS-4744 h3. Variations of the same theme. While exercising a load test of sorts on Nexus, I got this exception trying to deploy artifacts. The following simulation was running: 30 users fetching artifacts from releases 30 users deploying artifacts to releases 10 users deleting artifacts from releases 10 users adding and removing releases repo from public group repo 10 users expiring NFC cache of individual artifacts in releases repo Up to 100 users were also requesting uncached artifacts via a proxy repo for 'releases' on another machine.

Create a Synchronize Shadow Repository. In the repository selection list, all repositories are shown - however this task only applies to Virtual Shadow repositories.

308,nexus,jtom,"I noticed a bunch of warns like this when testing docker It appeared there was one for every layer I pulled that wasn't in the repository when I pulled from a docker group. For reference, some images can have 5-7+ layers. Pulling from proxy generated no such warn. There was no warn for layers that already existed so hypothetically this would be a diminishing concern over time (tho you could be utilizing new layers everyday, not sure how it works in practice). This seems excessive to do on the WARN level when there is no (as far as I can tell) adverse behavior. Filing for triage discussion. I did not check older NX3 or older docker at this time.. noted that he was seeing messages like: WARN *SYSTEM - Could not locate scanner descriptor"" This message was listed in NEXUS-8239 ( 5) but I believe at the time got mixed in with the actual 5 report (the double message) and I overlooked making a cleanup ticket against it. This occurs when you run the RHC tasks against a repository. Possible quick fix might be to add an empty properties file but code check would need to be done.. I noticed after uploading a license, that the license area shows ""This field is required"". This statement is not there before uploading. See attached. I am not totally convinced we need validation at all with the way our licensing is currently setup, but if we do have it I think the order of value is: 1) Show it when 2) Show it always 3) Show it after success License uploading has been broken for a while so not bothering to back check older NX3 as I'd need to check back before it was even broken (pre-official releases). I did not check NX2 at this time.. Noticed that when using a context path in Nexus when you put that path into your .bowerrc the resultant interactions error with errors like below. Only workaround seems to be not to use a context path. I am not sure how critical context path is for people so leaving major for now. On sudo bower install jquery bower not-cached nexus+ bower resolve nexus+ bower error (HTTP 404) Stack trace: Error: (HTTP 404) Request. at Console trace: Error Logger. rejected System info: Bower version: Node version: OS: Darwin x64 Setup was with a single bower group containing a bower proxy and context path nexus . Bower is new to so no backcheck (or NX2 check) can be done.. First time starting nexus via docker has karaf log warn. Starting nexus for the first time via docker generates the below warn. No adverse behavior is noted so far but keeping for record and to avoid log spam.

I found I cannot generate a file from the UI including everything checked in Windows. This does not occur in MacOSX. I checked with who was also able to see this, so not just my env. See below for long stack trace with several errors. On screen appears ""Cannot get property 'file' on null object"". This does not affect m7. I did not check NX2 at this time. Debug was off during this test.. I noticed that if you attempt to enter a value into ""Connection field within the ""HTTP request settings"" section of a proxy repository configuration you get an error ""Failed to Validate Facets, 1 Failure"" and the below in the This occurs with debug on or off. I did not check older NX3 at this time. This does not occur in ERROR admin - Failed to validate facet: Can not instantiate value of type from Floating-point number no method at (through reference chain: Source) Method) at 102 common frames omitted. Error on LDAP Realm activeness; can stop LDAP logins. I created a new raw hosted repository and then created a new role with read and edit repository view privileges to that new repository. Then I created a new user and gave it that new role. I noticed that I was able to add a file to that raw repository despite not having add privilege. As far as I know, add is not contained in edit and this seems a bug. I did not back check older NX3 or NX2 at this time. NX2 did use CRUD rather than BREAD which is testable however not sure the comparison is worth it unless to regression check.. I just noticed that if you're attempting to edit a docker repository, the port has validation over it that says ""Port is already in use"" and thus the saves cannot happen. Really annoying workaround is to delete the repo and recreate it. I doubt that will fly in a production env. Less (but still) annoying workaround is to change the port 1 number and make your changes then edit it back up and save again. I did not check older NX3 at this time but I suspect this is regression caused by a too tight NEXUS-9572. No docker in NX2 so no test needed there. Debug was off during this test. From WARN admin - Validation failed; 1 constraints violated: 1) Port is already in use, type: class property: value:. While testing the rebranded NX3 UI, various team members noticed that in some browser OS permutations, the header image was cached leaving the old N image and no version (see attached). If dev believes this should be 2 different tickets (or wants me to make subtasks) let me know. This did not happen in all browser OS permutations. You can force this to happen by clearing browser cache, loading a pre-rebrand version of Nexus to get the N image there and then loading the new version of Nexus. See attached let me know if unclear. As far as I can tell this does not affect the 404 page or the describe page which I think are templated slightly differnetly, so that may help. It may affect them and I did not have them cached am not 100% certain of that and have not double checked.. running rebuild npm hosted metadata scheduled task can change repository value. Some fields allow adding but not removal via keyboard. I noticed recently, that on fields which are for numbers that have arrows to increase or decrease, that you can add numbers to them via keyboard but you cannot remove them via delete. So, in attached screen (for example) I can make timeout equal to 2 by typing 2 into the field. I can subsequently make it 20 by adding a 0. But I cannot make it 2 again by deleting the 0. If you do this, nothing happens. Workaround is to use the arrow keys which can be annoying to impossible with bigger numbers (like docker port). You can now also workaround using provisional scripting. ADDENDUM: It was noticed while this was in progress you can also workaround this issue by highlighting the number and overwriting it. I checked m6 and this does not occur there so I believe recent regression. I did not check m7 or older NX3 at this time. I also did not check NX2 at this time. Debug was off during this test.. A comment with security level 'Developers' was removed.. A comment with security level 'Developers' was removed.. noticed in NX3 when you search for an unknown component it returns our 404 html rather than the handled error. Example of current: Example of expected: After checks with and , he asked me to file if I saw the same (which I do). I did not back check older versions of NX3, but I recall seeing this for a while and just assumed it was as it was supposed to be. Might be we deployed this way. I did not check NX2 at this time.. A comment with security level 'Developers' was removed.. resource does not check drop privilege. A comment with security level 'Developers' was removed.. Noticed that in Gnarly the ""Verify user mapping"" results from LDAP show results however, there's no modal title, columns or close button and the results are half off the screen and unscrollable to. You can however close the modal with the escape key as a workaround (though there's no workaround I see to seeing the full results or sorting). This behavior is specific to Gnarly as it works correctly in m6. I've included screens of both. noted this was this way when he started work on NEXUS-9370. There were a couple LDAP fixes in Gnarly however none I saw believe specific to this button modal. Debug was off during this test. I cleared my browser cache before each attempt to be sure nothing odd was caching.. Looking at a support issue I attempted UNKNOWN - Service failure Detected content type , but expected : Source) Source) at Source) Source) Source) Source) Source) Source) Source) Source) Source) Source) Source) Source) Source) Source) Source) All works with strict content type validation off. This is NOT the issue the user was seeing, however, does show a possible issue with content type validation and docker.. Content type validation blocks some docker fetching. While testing the initial RHC Lifecycle implementation for NX3, I noticed an error that said ""Error accessing Sonatype server: Professional license is required for access to this despite the fact my license was correct. I decided to change it but on doing so got the attached error. Despite it giving a green confirmation, the license did not update (so I was unable to perform the check above). I believe this worked in previous versions of pro so there may be something else going on. I am pretty sure this is due for an update but spoke with who suggested filing so we don't forget since we didn't make changes in this This occurs with both debug on and off. Despite my recollection, I didn't actually check older NX3 at this time. I've been running oss exclusively since m4-m5 timeframe. JS from debug mode: Uncaught TypeError: is not a function VM1057 VM1057 VM1034 VM1034 VM1034 VM1034 (anonymous function) VM1034 (anonymous function) VM1034 VM1034 VM1034 VM1034 VM1034 (anonymous function) VM1034 (anonymous function) VM1034. Base URL capability has a validation message for the URL field ""must be a valid URL"" - rest of the site has 'This field should be a URL in the format "" I looked to make it consistent but couldn't find it in github so I am ticketing instead. I made this a bug rather than an improvement because I think the level of confusion is potentially high if you enter and it asks for a ""valid URL"". I did not check older NX3 or NX2 at this time.. A comment with security level 'Developers' was removed.. Restore Task's notification email help text. While testing, I noticed an hourly scheduled task not running (see attached). On follow up test I was able to get it to run. I am able to reproduce this intermittancy consistantly by making the start time for the scheduled task in the past. For example, the one from the screenshot, I set to (AM) before remembering that this was military (24-hour clock) time. Nexus is smart and updates ""next run"" to the next hour, however, it seems the task never fires. If you have the start time in the future it seems to work fine. noticed similar in his NEXUS-7797 revamp I believe. He wrote: Start time: logs show: INFO admin - Store trigger: triggerClass: calendar: 'null' 0 nextFireTime: Mon Nov 02 PST 2015, UI shows: Next run Mon Nov 02 2015 GMT-0800 (PST) I actually do not see this log message line, but I believe it's the same issue after his comment in NEXUS-7797 in response to my test notes. I did not check older NX3 or NX2 at this time. Debug was off during these tests.. Hourly scheduled tasks can not run when UI next reports. Adjusting a schedule task updates last run and last result fields. If you have an existing non-manual scheduled task (iow a task with a start time set) if you click into it to see details then click away without making any adjustments you are prompted to discard changes or remain on the page. If you remain then click the discard button the start time goes blank and you are able to traverse away without prompt (on weekly schedule, the day to run the tasks also clears). Leaving minor since this is especially confusing since that field is required. This does not affect manual tasks because they have no start time. I did not check older NX3 or NX2 at this time however I do not believe it was related to the change (discovered while testing link) since it occurred in m6. also noticed this while performing the change itself (and relayed in an email). Debug was off during this test.. Just performed the following events in a fresh build of Gnarly: Cleared local .m2 repository folder Hit The pom was returned. Unless I am really confused I believe block setting is not working. I attempted the same test except instead of being blocked I disconnected from the internet and got back the (expected) 502 error. I tried again but did not clear cache and was able to see the pom (so it was cached). I attempted this in m6 and experienced the same behavior so do not believe it related to NEXUS-9182. No errors in log, debug was off during these tests. I did not check NX2 at this time. If this turns out to be NOTABUG, I would like to recommend we reevaluate the help and documentation text to be a smidge more clear.. Blocking repository does nothing. Installer does not create desktop icon in CentOS KDE. While testing the installer I ran a basic setup and at the end ""Completing the Sonatype Nexus Setup Wizard"", I kept 'Create Desktop Icons' checked. On CentOS KDE the icon did not create. I tried several permutations of installs and no dice. This blocked testing of several issues I was trying to test in Linux. On CentOS GNOME it did create so nothing is currently blocked however, I am filing at least because I believe it's worth documenting something not working when it is checked. Marking minor however I guess it's arguable if you're using CentOS KDE ) Recommendation to send to install4j. Review with Joe to see if increasing the logging levels gives better information.. Logger related(?) error at top of console after reset. noticed that he set the logger to TRACE, restarted nexus, and the logger value of was reset to ERROR. I was able to repro this but it does not happen for all loggers. I checked and the values are defined there but for some reason it is not picked up. We discussed whether this was a ""feature"" or not and also discussed if it has to do with customized loggers (and potentially the change from NEXUS-9327). When testing NEXUS-9327 I did not include restarting in the test Despite that discussion I did not check older NX3 at this time, nor did I check NX2. Debug was off during this test.. While reviewing group ordering, I uploaded the same npm project into two different hosted directories and had those hosted directories in a group. I noticed that the json information in the UI for the project via the group showed the second project that I had uploaded (see screen). However, because of the ordering I expected it to show the first json. The metadata did show the proper ordering so that ticket passed (see screen). I spoke with and he said to file and he would review debug. He noted that the json is(may be) going away with which may make this difficult to repro and or test. Test done with debug off. npm is new to Fabtastic and I did not check any other repo types in NX3. I did not check NX2 at all.. While demoing Tuesday, the team noticed that on Search the sign that usually is at the end of the row on search to indicate that you can click and see more was not in the last ""column"" but in the second to last column. This does not occur on normal search and in fact seems to only occur when you have a component twice in different repositories like attached screen (dated 10 1). This was demoed in NPM and that is how I reproduced it - creating two npm hosted repos and publishing the same package to both and then searching on the name. In addition, I tangentially noticed similar behavior on the Capabilities screen right out of the box. The differences seem to be that it does not take any special circumstances to get it to break and the is in the second column instead of the ""last"". See attached screen (dated 9 30). I was waffling whether this should be two issues or one. I conferred with who said start with one. Daniel suspects as I do, that the Capabilities issue (at least) is recent regression. I have not checked older NX3 or NX2 at this time. Test performed with debug off. Nothing in the log or JS console.. Can't create external LDAP Role mapping. A comment with security level 'Developers' was removed.. A comment with security level 'Developers' was removed.. Just noticed that if I delete a nuget asset then repush the nupkg to get the asset back it gives me the below error. If I delete the repo and push there is no error nor is there an error the first time, so I assume this Nexus and not the package. In the offchance this is behavior, I wanted to note I found the error strange. It reads like it's missing a download count however that doesn't make any sense to me since those kinds of attributes would seem to always be read or never (not the second time and fail). I did not check older NX3 or NX2 at this time. I was on MacOSX using curl to push, an unlikely use case however I did that both times (the first successful and the second errorful). I also did not check Windows at this time. ERROR admin - Unknown error Missing:. A comment with security level 'Developers' was removed.. While reviewing NPM, I noticed looking at browse search results all the json details were smushed together making IMO a tough reading experience. In fact, I believe it's much easier to read the json file itself (the contents are the same but the are not stripped). noted that 'we implemented ""nice"" display of attributes only for 1 level' and if extended it would show nicer. He also noted that some docker attributes have the same issue. This is an improvement ticket in that regard. I included a screen of current npm as well as a screen of current NuGet (which looks much better; though not a fair comparison provides a vision of something to strive towards). NPM browse search is new to NX3 and to Fabtastic so no back checking was done. I do not recall seeing the docker portion myself (implemented in m5, new to NX3), so did not attach screens cases however if I run across it, I will try and remember to do so.. I noticed that after saving a Capability change on the Summary tab that the Save Discard buttons remain enabled. This does not happen on the Settings tab, so I surmise this may have been fixed one place (by NEXUS-8833?) but not another. Similar tickets have definately existed (see some linked). There are no errors in the JS Debug was off during this test. I did not check older NX3 or NX2 at this time.. While running through security, I noticed that if you have just Roles permission, you get a warning that you cannot read privilges. While this is true, it is not necessary to create a role. Similarly, I think the placement of the warning is confusing. You get the warning before you enter the place where the fact you cannot read potentially matters (drilling down into creating the role). Note, that the users page has a similar issue when it comes to listing roles however that page CANNOT be used without, so there is no ticket for that. The combination of the ability for it to be used and confusing warning are causing me to file. See attached screen, let me know if unclear. I had debug off during this test. No errors appeared in the js console. Below appeared in the I did not check older NX3 or NX2 at this time. ERROR joedragons - Failed to invoke action method: java-method: User is not permitted: Method) at Caused by: Not authorized to invoke method: public at 26 common frames omitted. Clicking to run and running a scheduled task shows repository field briefly as required. A comment with security level 'Developers' was removed.. See attached (from Blobstores page). On smaller columns in IE(11), the sort arrow collides with the text. I noticed this first on where the default column sizes are pretty small (lots of data) and the initial sort (Timestamp) is affected. This does not happen in Chrome (Windows7) so this seems to be an IE specific issue. Working browsers have the arrow on the right and if the column gets too small, not shown at all. Being that the sort arrow is not first and on the same line, this is what I would have expected. Workaround, widen the column. I am pretty sure I have seen this before but did not see a ticket. Did not test older NX3 or NX2 at this time. Debug was off during this test.. A comment with security level 'Developers' was removed.. I noticed that if I went to Custom Search from any of the other child searches (Docker, Maven, NuGet, Raw) I got a continual loading mask that did not go away. If you go from Search parent or outside stuff (such as Welcome or Browse) it works. This occurs with Debug on and off and nothing in the log js console shows (though I mull if it's really continual that's why). This occurs with contents in the repos or with a fresh (content free) install. None of the other child searches seem affected in this way. I've attached a screen since it's about the same info as a vid, but if you want a vid let me know. I did not check older NX3 or NX2 at this time.. A comment with security level 'Developers' was removed.. Theres a delete button when viewing an asset in a group repository. We dont support delete in that scenario, so the button shouldnt be there, and if we do try to use it an NPE is thrown since the Asset id doesn't exist in the group repo bucket. Acceptance Criteria: - Remove the button from group repositories! NOTE: - The information to remove this easily is not currently available, we'd have to figure something out to indicate your are in a group repository INFO admin - Deleting asset: null ERROR admin - Failed to invoke action method: java-method: null Method) at Source) at Source) Method). A comment with security level 'Developers' was removed.. Support Zip page prompts for discard. I noticed when I created a Support Zip (via Admin Support) that when I removed some of the check boxes (I left ""System information report"" as well as the two Options) then closed the browser or navigated away I was prompted to discard changes or go back. This page is not able to be saved to my knowledge, so I think this prompt is out of place. Test done with debug off. NX2 is not affected by this. I did not check older NX3.. noticed that on the page the Realm list dropdown initially shows no items in it unless you go to the page first. This can be reproed both by logging in directly to or by logging in normally and navigating to before going to Then click on the realm dropdown. See vid. Both of us recall seeing this or something akin before but could not find a related ticket. I suspect this affects older versions of NX3 because of this but did not back check at this time. This does not affect NX2 because the setup is different. Testing done with debug off.. Verified thanks!. In case it helps, I am not seeing this on master on the quick. So either, that may lend a solution or it sometimes does not occur.. IE(11): Errors & non-functional pages after minimal site use. A comment with security level 'Developers' was removed.. I noticed that when I went to put a repository offline, right after I went to navigate away, I got a discard changes prompt. On repro attempt, I noticed when I unselected any checkboxes on the form, the save buttons remain enabled and the discard prompts fire. If you discard however, you will return to a screen where everything is saved NOT discarded. This is pretty confusing. See attached movie, let me know if unclear. It's even more confusing that it does not appear to affect the opposite way (selecting checkboxes) or using other field types (that I saw tried). While I originally saw this on repository, I was able to reproduce using Capabilities, so it's not repository specific. I did not check older NX3 or NX2 at this time. Test done with debug off.. While on a browse repository asset detail page anonymously, I logged in as admin and saw an error. I was able to get the same error logging into a component detail page. I also saw errors (though a different one) logging in to the file list (before details) as well as the component list (before file list on browse Components). Despite the error, everything appears fine to me. This also does not occur when you directly hit the URL so seems indirectly related to what I was testing. I decided to file one ticket as the behavior is identical, despite the differences in error; I suspect there will be two very similar fixes. If you'd like this broken out let me know. If this seems familiar, NEXUS-8728 is almost the exact same thing for search but no longer occurs in search. I did not check older NX3 or NX2 at this time. This occurs with debug on or off.

Errors after logging in from anonymous to some pages. A comment with security level 'Developers' was removed.. Browse Repository scroll not infinite. Earlier today I built NX3 using NX3 and had the normal 3000+ assets in my system. I noticed while reviewing something unrelated that on Browse UI, I only saw As and Bs in my component list for my dev group and central repo. Similarly, in Browse UI for assets I only saw As and Bs. I checked internal repos and more stuff than As Bs showed so the items are browsable. It appears that infinite scrolling is not infinite and it's stopping after pages. See attached vid. I thought maybe this was NEXUS-8988 but the workaround given there (going to a working repo then back) does not fix this. Also, I don't believe this is an issue with inclusion and more an issue with not being able to see everything. Because this was working with NEXUS-8988, I believe this recent regression. The behavior persists even after a browser restart. It occurs with both Debug on and off. I see no errors in nexus log or js console (or dev console). Workaround would be to search, which is lame, but I gave minor priority since it is valid.. A comment with security level 'Developers' was removed.. Finishing asset detail page testing (NEXUS-8255), I noticed that NuGet assets were being listed and downloaded in the form of If you rename the download to it's proper name (in this case original file was or even improper with a nupkg extension (tried they work. So the data is there, I think maybe just malformed slightly somehow. However, as far as download goes, I imagine it'd be pretty annoying to NuGet users trying to get their assets this way. Left major because of this. Asset details are new to Edgy so does not affect older NX3. I did not check NX2 at this time, tho I suspect unaffected. Test performed with Debug off.. Testing NEXUS-8848, I noticed that I changed from asset details to search another type (raw to maven) and got the attached error. On further exploration this error seems to fire anytime you switch from a second level detail (such as result from search or a repository from repositories) to another left nav item and does not seem search specific. Example: Select Repositories, select to edit an existing repository and select Blobstores. This error occurs with Debug on or off. Screens are with debug on. After the error occurs, you cannot see details any longer in the UI. You can navigate but no new data appears in the frame. Also expanding the dev console is largely unreadable (though since this occurs with debug off, I doubt this is related). Thus I am leaving this major. Refreshing the UI does fix this however. I did not check older versions of NX3 at this time. Since there are really no ""levels"" I recall in NX2, I doubt this affects NX2 but did not check at this time. Nothing in the Full JS: Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property of VM2838 VM2838 VM2838 VM2838 VM2838 VM2653 VM2653 VM2653 VM2653 VM2877 VM2653 VM2653 VM2653 VM2653 VM2653 VM2653 VM2653 VM2653 VM2653 VM2653 VM2653 VM2653 VM2653 VM2653 VM2653 VM2653 VM2653 VM2731 VM2653 VM2653 VM2653 VM2653 VM2735 VM2735 VM2653 VM2653 VM2653 VM2653 VM2653 VM2653 VM2653 VM2653 VM2653 VM2653 VM2653 VM2653 VM2653 VM2653 VM2653 VM2653 VM2653 VM2653 VM2653 VM2653 VM2653 VM2653 VM2653 function) VM2653.

A comment with security level 'Developers' was removed.. I just went to create LDAP and noticed that when configuring ""User and Group"", I could not save with Group Type being Dynamic or without mapping LDAP groups as roles. There was a validation firing that (if reading correctly) Group Member Format (a variable under Static Group configuration) was required. See attached and log snip below. I was able to change to Static Group configuration and create my LDAP. If you then go back and edit, you can make it dynamic group configuration or remove mapping LDAP groups as roles altogether, but you cannot remove the value from that field. If you do, it restores it to what you did before you saved. This occurs with ?Debug on and off. Editing post-creating is a pretty poor workaround and also 3 of our templates use dynamic groups so appear not to work with this as is, so leaving major. This worked in some builds of m4, so is at least semi-recent regression. I did not go back and check pre-Edgy so am not sure how recent. I also didn't check against NX2, tho this was working last time I attempted it, assuming NX3 specific. I don't believe this has anything to do with the linked issue, however, linking for thoroughness. ERROR admin - Failed to invoke action method: java-method: The field cannot be null, record: ldap mapping at Source) at Method). In order to use the Browse UI, you need read privileges (like below example). This is contradictory to search which you just need privileges (you need these for Browse UI as well). I am pretty confident this is a bug, because anonymous by default cannot use Browse UI (because of this). By default, anonymous shows it has no permission to see any repositories in Browse UI. Bringing up at least for triage; in case not a bug, don't think intuitive so I think worth documenting. Browse UI is new to Edgy so does not affect older NX3. I did not check NX2 at this time. Example:. Messages slow to fully appear sometimes. A comment with security level 'Developers' was removed.. While testing the Browse UI (NEXUS-8888 and various other tickets), I clicked into Unattached Assets and into details and got the attached errors (and it does not show more details). While NEXUS-8255 is not complete, I mentioned to and he asked me to file seperately. This is that ticket. There is nothing in the for this error (at default levels). This is a recent error, likely caused by initial NEXUS-8255 efforts, however, there were limited details shown before NEXUS-8255 efforts. Just stating this because I know this error does not occur in m4. This also does not occur in NX2.. Capabilities: Changing state does not change related aspects of UI. In Capabilities when you change the state the following items do not immediately update which could lead to confusion. * The enable disable buttons do not switch to reflect that one is no longer Create Capability - ""Base URL: Force"" (for example, any one should do; one already created probably ill advised) 3) Click to edit. Note State on the Summary tab is ""Active"". 4) Click Settings tab. Note active button is ""Disable"" and checkbox is checked (signifying Enabled). 5) Click ""Disable"" button. BUG: Checkbox remains checked (signifying Enabled) and active button remains ""Disable"". If you click back to the Summary tab, you'll note the state is still active.. After running the Rebuild Maven Repository Metadata task, I refreshed to see the status and noticed it said ""Unknown running"". This appears to be the default return. Analysis from states the task may be STARTING and suggestion is to add a state for that. I feel like this may be a recent change but maybe just unlucky timing on my side. I did not check older NX3 (task (re)added in m4) or NX2 at this time. I waffled between Bug and Improvement; bug for now but made it trivial. Debug was off when I noticed this.. when searching while searching. A comment with security level 'Developers' was removed.. A comment with security level 'Developers' was removed.. With tasks-read and tasks-create permissions, I can click the button to create a new task however, I cannot access some of the fields (including the required ones in both of the current tasks). Oddly, I can access some of the fields. Once I add ""tasks-update"" permission, the tasks become creatable. Not only does this seem odd but it's not how any of the other permissions I've tested function, so I'm filing for eval. I did not test older NX3 or NX2 at this time. Debug off during these tests.. With help from and , it was revealed that the error I received while testing NuGet was a generic 500 and that needs to be made into a specific error. I noticed this twice and will put details below, however, only one case was reproducable. A) While testing NEXUS-8714 (MacOSX), I left my HTTP Proxy configured when running the curl. This generated the error every time. Steps to repro: 1) From Security HTTP, check HTTP Proxy. Configure a non-working proxy (mine was Charles defaults without Charles on; so HTTP proxy host localhost, HTTP proxy port 8888). Save. 2) From console run curl from NEXUS-8714, ""curl -v -o B) While testing NEXUS-8611 (Windows7), I tried to use the nuget command line to install FaceSharp (nuget install FaceSharp -source NX3Proxy). This did not complete with an error 500 on the command line screen (see attached) but also with the error occurring. This was not reproducable. I suspect after successful install this was caused by a timeout that may be able to be reproduced with throttling if my suspicions are right. But as such there are no steps at this time. I did not test older NX3 or NX2 at this time, though I suspect (at least in the case of NX3) the issue is because of ""new"" NuGet (revamped in m4). Error in both cases: WARN admin - Service failure null at. I see no evidence currently that on NX3 LDAP configuration using Verify Connection the ""retry after"" and ""max failed attempts"" (latter I believe new for NX3) is working. I noticed this testing NEXUS-8655 after verifying the wait seconds before timeout field was working as I expected. This appears to ""work"" in NX2, but without ""max failed attempts"" it basically tries to connect forever (which is probably why the third field was added). I did not check older NX3 at this time. On discussion with , he asked if I would close NEXUS-8655 if the first field was working and open a distinct ticket on the second and third fields. This is that ticket. Repro steps: 1) Setup a valid LDAP (first page) but make the port an invalid port. 2) Click verify connection. The connection will try for the number of seconds listed in the first variable then nothing. I attempted low settings and retries to get this to fire faster (such as 10 2 and 1 5).. A comment with security level 'Developers' was removed.. Noticed that in NX3, when configuring LDAP, the Verify User Mapping button gives the attached error and does nothing. This also appears as a JS error in the console: ""Uncaught me is not defined ADDENDUM: This shows as ""Uncaught me is not defined - with ?debug on. This works in NX2. I did not check older milestones of NX3 but this is not regression of the ticket discovered by. I am leaving this major because this is a super easy way to make sure this configuration is working before actually working with LDAP stuff. I am not sure if there's anywhere else that does that in one button click which makes for a poor workaround.. While reviewing Crowd, I tried different values for both HTTP and Crowd specific Request Timeout and only the 0 value appeared to affect Crowd (would cause seemingly endless attempts to reconnect on a ""bad"" I asked the team what this field was supposed to do to clarify I was testing the right thing and it was inferred I should create a ticket for review. I tried values of 60, 1 and 20000 (in case millseconds regression) in the field. I tried with Crowd off and valid as well as Crowd on and ""bad"" and it immediately gave me a validation no matter what configuration (except in the 0 case). I tried less combinations on the fallback general HTTP values but my findings were those are not being picked up either. Investigation appreciated. If not just me, all the above should probably be (re)tested once a solution is implemented. I did not check older NX3 or NX2 to see if working not working at this time.. A comment with security level 'Developers' was removed.. A comment with security level 'Developers' was removed.. noticed that repositories with version policies cannot be saved. I checked master and see when I save I get a ""may not be null"" message under these. I checked through the default ones and think it just proxy and hosted maven that are affected. Alin says this is related to NEXUS-8503 and ""that is becuase disabling a field will result into those fields to not be submitted and that will not pass repository validation"". I guess when I checked that I only checked by sight, my bad Below also appears in the log: WARN admin - Validation failed; 1 constraints violated: 1) may not be null, type: class property: value: null This does not impact NX2 or older NX3 builds.. I noticed that the Online helper text (seen when creating or editing a repository) spans 3 lines and it seems it could be 1 line saving space and consolodating the page a bit. in seems to be defined as 1 string without breaks, so I assume this is a page ""issue"". We've specifically spoken about real estate on this page so filing improvement. This is recent regression to Dizzam and I suspect unintentional fallout (perhaps from ?). Spoke to about this before filing.. Chrome: Cannot use scroll wheel to view some bundles details. I just noticed that I cannot scroll through the bundles details using the scroll wheel of my mouse or the the trackpad of my laptop when in Chrome. FF works fine and the bundles list also works fine (in Chrome). Something about the bundles details. Workaround is to use the scrollbar on the right side or just mousing over it and scrolling. Copy highlight mouse dragging also works (tho is an ugly workaround). Note, keyboard also isn't a workaround but is not part of this issue as it doesn't work on the list or in FF either. Seems just that keyboard movement through pages is not supported. The bundles revamp is new to Dizzam. I did not check older versions of NX3 to see if the same issue affects Plugins. I did not check NX2 at this time.. I noticed that on the RAW search, if you click ""More Criteria"" there's an option for ""Raw Repositories"" but it contains no items. When you drill into, it does open a menu but since there are no items there's a single grey line. The non-menu type items on this page have a more expected function: you pick them and they disappear from the list. This issue is not limited to RAW. You can get this to repro with any menu item that has a second level by adding all the items in that item to the search. I did not check older versions of NX3 or NX2 at this time. Steps to repro (this is just the one the attached screen shows): 0) Do not need to login (unless your anonymous is messed up). 1) Click on + to expand Search 2) Click on Raw 3) Click on More Criteria 4) Hover over ""Raw Repositories"". BUG: Selector is blank.. While trying to repro this on other pages (per Alin's comment), I noticed that I have been able to get the Users page to ""blank out"". The behavior is similar to the desc (create, edit a lot) but not reproducable (yet) or exactly the to figure it out. Seen 4-5 times now though. Attaching screen in case anyone has earlier thoughts. ADDENDUM: Behavior definately unreproducable UNLESS refresh (via top bar) does not reset what's causing it to happen (or it's timing related). I got it to occur by clicking admin, scrolling to bottom, breadcrumb ""back"", clicking deployment, scrolling to bottom, breadcrumb ""back"", clicking create, breadcrumb ""back"", BUG. Second attempt (post-refresh via top bar) did not break.. A comment with security level 'Developers' was removed.. FYI, today testing unrelated, I saw this behavior just switching from repo to repo (default ones) in OSS. I am not going to assume it's the same from the back and forth but wanted to relay. Am trying to come up with a reproducable case and if I can, I'll link here.. Category column disappears from Capabilities page. -While reviewing the NX3 documentation for Capabilities, I noticed that there was a section describing a Category column. I thought this hangover from NX2 but noted he saw it in OSS (I was testing -I double checked and see what he did. OSS has a Category column in the Capabilities section and PRO does -I can't think of any reason for this inconsistancy so -The category does show when inside the details of the Capability so making trivial. I did not check older NX3 or NX2 at this UPDATE: Testing unrelated today, I noticed the Category column missing from OSS. It appears on initial load, but disappears if you leave the page and return. I rechecked PRO and the same thing happens. Sorry for initial misanalysis and titling.. A comment with security level 'Developers' was removed.. Disconnect between Admin UI and nuget-hosted config. While testing pushing a NuGet artifact, I noticed that the new Admin UI had Deployment Policy set automatically for the default NuGet hosted repo as read only. Despite this I was able to push a NuGet artifact. On further investigation with , we discovered that the initial configuration displayed in the admin UI is not reflected in the database (see attached - row 5). Further, changes to that repo configuration do not update the DB, despite reflecting in the UI. Using a newly configured NuGet hosted repo works properly and is the workaround. This is new to CMA with the addition of the admin UI so no NX3 back checking is possible at this time. There are no default NuGet repos in NX2 so cannot compare there either.. The new CMA default (host) repo creation has deployment policy set as read only. The NX2 default was dependant upon the release policy (disable redeploy for release, allow redeploy for snapshot, etc). After speaking with and this did not sound intentional so filing. These policies are new to CMA so no back checking of NX3 can be performed. Workaround to select what deployment policy is correct manually. This also affects the default NuGet hosted repo and caused me to find the related (linked) defect.. Noticed that when you enter in a ""?"" or space on creation of a repository in the Name field you get a validation Seems the validation message for ""bad"" names (vs empty names) is undefined. I checked all available repo types and it affects them all. The legacy repo message is For reference, not saying that should be the new message necessarily (tho it reads fine to me if true). This is new to CMA and does not affect older versions of NX3. Nor NX2.. A comment with security level 'Developers' was removed.. While testing NEXUS-8447, I was on System Email Server in Verify SMTP Connection popout and clicked to cancel. Doing so (with no emailed filled in) caused validation to occur. A second click closes the popout successfully. Having emailed filled in and clicking cancel also behaves correctly. I guess this is likely the same fix as NEXUS-8430. It's definately similar behavior.. Saw this after about 6 hours idling. Only once, seems different but unsure if related. FYI. Screen also showed attached message, which I don't recall seeing before. I know we have a countdown and expiry but this seems neither.. Log Viewer shows entire log despite size selection. While performing UX review, I noticed in System Information the Print window not scrollable (so just shows screen height worth of lines). This does occur in m3 (checked at Daniel's request) or in NX2.. A comment with security level 'Developers' was removed.. stray null appears on System Information load in IE11. On cancel, window does not return in full view sometimes. In the left navigation of IE11, when a main area is collapsed (via the - icon or by default) a + icon does not show to reexpand it. You can click on the blank area and it will expand. I left severity major because this is potentially confusing for any who are collapsed by default and or mistake. Borderline minor with the workaround. I've attached a screen of this working in not-IE from Daniel, which may be the easiest way to explain (since absence of +s is hard to point out, tho can be screened). I did not check older versions of NX3 at this time. This does not affect NX2 as there are no + - icons there.. While doing UX review, I noticed the below pages do not have Saving masks that the rest of the pages do. After speaking with Daniel we agreed on one ticket. Tasks - Settings (when saving a Task) LDAP (saving to create an LDAP) I did not check NX2, this perhaps is an improvement but not worrying about that now.. Some pages actions have inconsistant masks. Some pages actions have inconsistant masks re: changes. Filing one ticket to update after speaking with Daniel. Staging Bundle - ""Upload mask"" appears to be the whole page not just the area.. A comment with security level 'Developers' was removed.. While testing NEXUS-8016, I had added Central to the default nuget group (nuget-group) but later decided I wanted an independant group to test, so removed Central. Later when I ran the following curl against nuget-group, I was seeing two warnings about incompatable repositories even thought there weren't any. discovered that there's a problem with removing repositories from CMA such that they will not remove until you restart and then remove them. He is digging into any other this might affect but asked me to file a ticket. curl -u -X GET -v "" I did not check older versions of NX3 at this time. Steps to reproduce: 1) Login to NX3 as admin 2) Go to 3) Edit nuget-group to include Central and save 4) Edit nuget-group to exclude Central (only include the original two nuget repos - proxy and hosted) and save 5) Run the above CURL. Note there are two WARNs in the log saying Central is included. NOTE: The first time this broken I noticed loading nuget-group via the UI after step 4, I did not see Central in the configuration (json) however on Nexus restart I did see Central in the configuration (json). I tried to repro this and it did not occur again.. TestNote: Verified first two in case someone takes this over.. Use present instead of the current year in the copyright notice. Elasticsearch seems to be more finicky that our data model allows right now, and likely spaces in Repository names is something we want to support. And after removing the space we find we don't allow uppercase letters: To reproduce just add a new Repository in the UI with a space or capital letter in the name. An unhelpful error is shown in the UI: ""Failed to start facets"" Minimally we should add validation to ensure that we don't allow invalid characters, as right now we end up with configured Repositories that cannot possibly function. Acceptance criteria: - names should be validated in the UI, and provide guidance when illegal names are tried - names should be validated on the server using the same rules as the abuse of the ExtDirect api) - names should only allow (English) alphanumeric and (dash, underscore, period) - names should be sanitized for elasticsearch usage in index names; this requires enforcing uniqueness of names as indexes are all lowercase. A comment with security level 'Developers' was removed.. While testing NEXUS-7758, I went to create a task and filtered, but realized I missed something so switched to repositories. After finding the info I needed, I returned to Tasks but my create button was greyed I was able to repro this reliably by filtering on a second level (Tasks) returning to a base level (not even filtering) and then returning. Steps below. I went to see if this was an issue in m3 but as far as I can tell there are no second level filters in m3, this is a new concept to Dizzam. This also does not affect NX2 (same reason but more basic). Borderline minor as the workaround is to browser. I do not believe this is related to where I found it but linking in case wrong and for completeness. Steps: 1) Login to NX3 (Dizzam) as admin 2) Click Tasks (admin section, under System) 3) Click Create 4) Filter by something (like ""whatever"") 5) Click Repositories (left nav item under Repository) 6) Click Tasks again. BUG: Create is out.. While testing NEXUS-7758, I created a fake LDAP just to make sure all the newly formed dialogues were working functionally. Note, my intention was not to create a real LDAP setup and I don't think that matters in this case. After filling out Connection information and clicking next, I went to fill out ""User and group"" information. In past iterations, I had picked a configuration template but this time just filled in the required variables. When I got down to Group Type, I decided to uncheck ""Map LDAP group as roles"" (figuring correctly this would hide the required field, thus in essence making it fill). On creation click, I got the following error in the log as well as a from the UI. The UI error struck me the most because almost all of our warnings are defined so you can tell what the error was. ERROR admin - Failed to invoke action method: java-method: null at Method) Method) at Method) at My original test was in Safari but I confirmed in Chrome (both MacOSX). After doing this, I found that if I left the box checked and filled in the value, everything worked (thus templates were also working). After realizing that, I checked m3 and it was working there. This also works in NX2. This seems new to Dizzam.. Subheader text contains redundancy with content. In NEXUS-7758, the capability details were merged from 4 areas to 2. One of the things that moved was the Notes (About) section. However, in the post-deploy, I noticed that the details area has a header ""Notes"" but the old details also have I checked with and we agree it's redundancy and can be removed. Because so much of NEXUS-7758 is working, filing a separate ticket to avoid failing the ""parent"" over something so small. See attached for how it is now (one example), if you need more or old screens let me know. Because of recent adjustment this is not an issue in NX2 or NX3-m3 (or earlier).. A comment with security level 'Developers' was removed.. On Login, Password appears filled in IE11. In NEXUS-7959 it was revealed ( 3) that you can double click column headers to expand contents to full width, giving this column ""priority"". I noticed when you do this with columns with shorter content (like Status) part of the words remain cutoff. I suspect this is because the column width includes the filter dropdown but the space for the contents does not (not sure tho, but that is how it appears). I did not check NX2 at this time. Acceptance Criteria: * If I double click to see contents of a column, I want to see full contents, not ellipsed contents.. A comment with security level 'Developers' was removed.. While reviewing NEXUS-7959 ( 1), from Repositories I removed the type column then added it back (having the original columns there) and noticed that many of the columns, including the lengthy name column were super small. I am not sure if this was because of NEXUS-7959 but I definitely think the resizing could be better. On refresh, everything resizes correctly, but on refresh all the hidden columns are restored as well, so that doesn't really mean much. Waffled between Improvement and Bug; feel free to swap it if you want. If unclear you prefer a movie let me know. I did not check NX2 at this time; I suspect NX3 specific.. Clarify Yum Capability helper text. Reviewing Capabilities I noticed that in Yum: Generate Metadata and Yum: Staging Generate Metadata that the Aliases field had helper text ""Format: "". I had no idea what this meant and after reviewing the book at 's prompting, I found that it means that the Aliases field is comma delineated Even knowing this, I feel this is unclear. Suggest we replace with that fact or just put an example (either in helper text or in greytext in the field itself). I did not check older versions of NX3 at this time.. Saving shows a validator briefly when condition is fulfilled fields). While reviewing NEXUS-7901, I created a task and edited it and noticed that a validator was appearing despite the fact the field was filled in. This occurs on both save and discard.

While testing NEXUS-7705, I noticed that when creating a new task when scheduling Advanced (Cron) the long guidance text describing Cron examples was gone. I asked in email if this was intentional and it was decided that rather than having long examples, there would be an entry in the help content that we could link our helper text to. I waffled between making this a task or a bug, but since the text is removed, I went with bug. This is NX3 only as the text is present in NX2. I believe this cannot be done until the link is added so added dependancy. Acceptance Criteria: - Have a cron context help link to the Nexus Book. As a user, it'd be nice to have a persistent message when I come back to a session and am logged out. Two times today, I've been idling on NX3 and on return to the screen have had a pause then realized I am logged out presumably due to idling. One benefit of NEXUS-7755 was that there was a history including that you were logged out. Right now, you can potentially just click anonymously before realizing what happened. Suggesting a message on the screen relaying you have been logged out that persists until the user clicks it off (or otherwise notes it as being seen). If NEXUS-7755 or like history is restored, then this could likely be OBE.. As a it'd be good to have a clean indicator that the server is started in the console. In training, it is mentioned that you can see Nexus has started by looking at ""Started Usability suggestion, add a line after the system processes are done Nexus has or something akin. This is not unlike the Initializing message currently present (and I personally feel would be more useful). This is just for nexus console. Nexus start has a clean(ish) message.

Docker repositories may be accessed in four basic Using the default URL or HTTP (when NX is behind a secure proxy) Using the default URL or HTTP or HTTPS We need to make these options more explicit in the UI. There are a few things we could do to make the UI clearer: Briefly describe how we expect each kind of URL to be used (supplemented by online docs) HTTPS is the preferred way of interacting with Nexus using the Docker CLI. Consider saying this in the help text, or selecting it by default (once the optional fieldset has been checked).. The problem is with settings panels that handle their own load state. Most of the time, load and submit are specified via the api config option: This results in the `submitted` and `loaded` events being called, respectively. The function takes advantage of the config option to reset a forms dirty state when `setValues` is called. We set the values to the return value from `getValues`. However, `getValues` omits fields with an undefined value (for example, checkboxes that arent checked). `setValues` only resets the dirty state of fields for which it has a value. Because unchecked checkboxes arent passed to it, they stay dirty, and the save discard buttons remain enabled. There are a couple approaches we can use to fix this: 1) Add 'off'` to each affected checkbox ( 2) Override the `getValues` method of the `SettingsForm` component to return values for all fields, not just fields with a defined value. 3) Figure out how to emulate the normal behavior of the component (where both `submit` and `load` are handled by the framework) These solutions are ordered by complexity. 1 is simplest. 3 is hardest. Ive filed a PR which fixes the problem using the first approach. Thoughts?. Demo: This bug only occurs in ?debug mode.

As a user, if I add columns to a results page, I would like them to remain that way at least for the duration of my session. While testing CLM, I searched and then added Security Issues and License Threat columns to see the results. Unsatisfied I did another search and noticed that those added columns were removed. I realized we just talked about this in a semi-recent meeting but did not see a ticket. I also assume this is behaving as desired and is not a bug. If I am wrong, please feel free to adjust the issue type. While my example was for search, I think this use case would be good for all pages. There was discussion about making this longer than a session, which would solve the minimal case I mentioned above. I did not test NX3 at this time because I believe search (specifically) is in flux.

This took me aback because I am not sure the purpose of having a dropdown with just 1 item, seems like extra clicks to me.

I strongly suspect some of these are there however (some may not be, a result from the move from tabs).. Demonstration of the bug: Currently in NX when you have the box icon at the top of the screen selected (or the gear if logged in as admin), if you click to unselect it, it removes the blue indicating that the item is selected but nothing else changes. This was confusing to me as a new NX3 user. For example, if logged in as an admin with the gear selected, if you unselect the gear you remain on the administration section. The only thing that changes is the fact the gear icon is no longer blue. When I posed this to the team, it was requested I file a ticket. My expectation was that there be some behavior when the icons are not selected or suggest that they not be able to be unselected if no behavior is going to occur.

315,nexus,cstamas,"NX2 proxied items should have ""remoteUrl"" attribute set. All the cached proxied items in NX2 should have ""remoteUrl"" attribute set. Known affected formats so far: all formats should be reviewed (and fixed where needed) for lack of attribute. In short, the setup: group, that contains two members, one proxy and one hosted. The requested metadata is contained in a proxy (but is also deployed on same path in hosted repeatedly). This setup group should never return 404, as the requested metadata does exists, even under load. Current code does not uses the fact that merged metadata content is and does an unneeded roundtrip to Storage that introduces concurrency issues with group cache.. This affects latest NX2 it seems. NX2 claims it will keep alive the connection (default with and even ensures it with a header if client is (as with that protocol level extra header is needed), but then immediately drops connection on response is sent. This leaves no chance for connection pooling clients (like NX2 NX3, unlike Wagons) to properly handle connections, as connections returned to pool and believed to be alive will be actually immediately closed. OOTB Jetty 8 does not do this, this has to be something in NX2. Either fix the a) connection to remain alive if said so, or b) as simpler fix just add ""Connection: close"" header when client is and prevent addition of (done by Jetty) ""Connection: keep-alive"" header when client is Marked as affects but it might affect other versions too.. NX3 proxy fetches more than should. It seems we have a bug in indicate verified is invoked only after remote responds with 304, but it never happens with servers not supporting conditional GETs. Also, on servers supporting conditional GETs, it will be (potentially close) GET request that will mark the cache content as ""verified"", not honoring ""maxItemAge"" to perform re-check. Problems in short: 1. - refetches always if remote does not support conditional GET (as no 304 arrives) 2. - fetches two times if remote does support conditional GET (as 304 will arrive on 2nd fetch, that is made conditional from cached content) 3. - fetches on every ""stale"" detected content if the format does not support lastModified and or ETag. In this case unconditional GET is issued, and remote item is refetched over and over again, even if the locally cached one is same . Fix for first two should be trivial in just indicate verified on initial fetch too (200). For 3rd issue, proper Content support is needed.. Similar issue to NEXUS-8637, this case also currently results in HTTP 500 Internal Error, but should not. Downstream 404 Not Found is more appropriate, OR, in case of deploy, 400 Bad Request.. While the policy is enforced, the log gets an ugly stack-trace and response code of 500 Internal Error which is not acceptable. Response should be 400 Bad Request.. Create raw hosted repository named ""site"". Use the project at This setup works in Nexus 2. Create a hosted raw repo with the name ""site"". run mvn site-deploy That should work. Even if you turn of strict content type validation and allow redeploys it doesnt work.. Connection leak in RRB when content encoding is gzip. There is a connection leak in RRB, but under normal circumstances the leak is handled gracefully by GC and HttpClient. Still, in case when remote uses gzip and or chunked transfer encoding, the connections are NOT reused even after longer period, leading to connection pool depletion. Original reporter's description: When I'm browsing a remote maven repository in after maybe steps through the remote repository tree, I get an infinitly spinning cirle. Refresh doesn't work either. The only way to continue browsing the repository is to restart Nexus. This seems to impede all communication with the remote repository.

NPM hosted repository should maintain ""time"" field on deploys. Basically this algorithm (from npm couchdb server) needs to be ""ported"" to hosted repositories: Due to lack of this, the only known downside (or ""bug"" if you like) is that commands listing package metadata (like is) will mark the package as ""prehistoric"". Example output (packages deployed by user ""deployment"" user are locally published ones):. As per registry spec, version descriptor objects are not mandatory, and a URL where to find them is allowed too (see registry root description or Package Root Object's version field).

LDAP OSS to Pro upgrade bug, multiple fields are not carried over. Discovered while adapting OSS ITs to now merged Pro LDAP (issue is NEXUS-6591). On upgrade of OSS config to Pro config, the flag introduced for NXCM-370 is lost (""userBaseDn"" is optional, when subtree search is used) and some others too. This should be fixed in In master, the work changes done as part of NEXUS-6591 fixes the problem. OSS ITs that now run against Pro LDAP plugin caught this.. Acceptance Criteria: On upgrade, latest pgp configuration will be converted to a capability Users will have to first upgrade to to get on latest pgp configuration. Update Shiro dependency to. Seems like issue NEXUS-5418 introduced even more as known, and it made ""Rebuild Maven Metadata"" defunct (unverified, as reported by user on HC). It caused a known inconsistency, that proxy repositories response on file retrieval of SHA1 (and MD5) files basically ""redirected"" response to main file (the file that asked checksum belongs to) and served the response generated for main item corresponding attribute. This does not happen in hosted or group repositories, but should. The problem reported by user probably stems from same change, as ""Rebuild Maven Metadata"", once you end up with wrong checksums, does not recalculates them, but restores the bad ones from attributes.. The ""?asExpired"" flag is meant to invalidate local cache and force a ""remote check"" for requested item. Still, it is getting blocked by NFC, if the item is not locally cached, but is in NFC.. Basically, similar (if not same) fix should be applied to it as was done here: Also, it similarly breaks Map contract as AppContext does.. See attached video. In short, with CLM configured, at Staging profile south panel, the ""CLM Application Management"" link is shown, but it leads to wrong URL (having CLM Brain responding with 404): Note the double slash (). Manually removing one slash leads to page okay. When no application selected, the ""CLM Dashboard"" is correct, leads to proper page on Brain.. Capabilities that depend on repository cause Stack Overflow when repository is put Out of Service. FSPeer wrongly assumes is always a good candidate for tmp file creation. FSPeer wrongly assumes is always a good candidate for tmp file creation. This might not always be true (especially for non-maven layouted repositories, but even Maven layouted ones might contain such files, made by some custom Nexus plugin or external tooling). The code in question is here:. Consolidate logging levels in Nexus Core. Many log entries have wrong levels (INFO instead of DEBUG), and many of them dumps stack traces at unexpected levels (like stack trace dumped on INFO level). Chat about this at the very end of IRC. Rationalize Nexus Core dependencies and components. Core is currently bloated, and contains many ""key"" dependencies pinned in, that simply prevents plugin developers easy upgrades (to follow their own dependencies). On the other hand, key dependencies that are extensively used in key features like Maven Repository Support are moved out into foreign projects, pinning our core to depend on foreign release lifecycle, but also forcing us on ""compromises"" needed to maintain backward compatibility with other non-nexus integration for that 3rd party library.. Use downgradable locking implementation in Nexus. We have a fixed locking implementation available which should solve quite a few problems with the current If we're going to move to this implementation we should do it sooner rather than later, and should do an internal release of Nexus at least a month before the official release so we can get experience with it running on our servers. The change introduces ""downgrading"" of locks (in both, Nexus own and in wrapper wrapping sisu-locks). The use of distributed locks was already possible by a system property switch.. Artifact maximum age does not have any effect for proxied release artifacts (NEXUS-3069). However, the UI element for this is still enabled. We need to revisit the reason for NEXUS-3069 (and it's original reason NEXUS-3065), and if possible restore this functionality (since it breaks staging).

I would (perhaps naively) expect that this would just result in a 404. Truncated exception from log shown below: This was triggered with a request against the api for a version that does not exist:. Docker search against group is incorrectly sorted. When NuGet searches are performed, the search cache is primed with data from the result but the actual binaries are not yet downloaded. When you navigate to the Assets view for one of these and click the download link the content is fetched, but the status shown on the screen does not update until after you navigate away and back. The refresh button does nothing in this context. The expectation is that the info about the asset should be updated, which might include a refresh of the store after the content is fetched. Recreation steps: - ute a search against our proxy repo: curl -u -X GET -v "" - Browse in the UI to any of the results of the above search; on a newly installed system this should be all results - note that 'Locally cached' is false - click the path link and download the asset - observe that the UI does not update 'Locally cached' and other related info (File size and Blob Ref). Theres a delete button when viewing an asset in a group repository. We dont support delete in that scenario, so the button shouldnt be there, and if we do try to use it an NPE is thrown since the Asset id doesn't exist in the group repo bucket..

Execute the count query again and note that it has incremented despite the activity happening on a different repo Test for this condition is presently commented out in for this ticket), and should be re-enabled to confirm this when fixed.. Component fetch from group repo does not respect repository ordering. The expectation is that if a component is present in more than one repository, the ordering of group members will determine which one is returned. Presently we just return the first matching record, regardless of the configuration, although the query uted is indeed different. Given a hosted repository to which I've published a component downloaded from a proxy, both of these queries return the same result regardless of the group membership configuration: Similarly, browsing a group repository will show the same component regardless of the group membership ordering. Test for this condition is presently in NugetGroupIT, and should be re-enabled to confirm this when fixed.. NuGet assets do not download with correct filename.

UI Component and Asset details page urls should be transportable. As a User I would be able to copy the link for the page I am looking at and share that link with someone else. noticed that if you copy a link for an element you are looking at details for, when you hit the bookmark it takes you to the base Browse UI page (selecting a repo). I verified this and the fact it does not occur for search, although likely will be an issue for any of our Drilldown views which require multiple levels of context during normal navigation. This is new to NX3 and NX2 is not browsable in this exact way (but is bookmarkable for the non-tree path version).. When checking to see if an index already exists the raw repository name is used, but elasticsearch stores indices in lowercase only. This leads to an exception being thrown on update as we try to create the same index again. Any repository created with uppercase letters can be used to trigger this behaviour; on an update from the UI you will be greated with a 'facet failed to start' message..

Because the password was not clearcase I am not sure at this time what was being filled in there. I assume this could be potentially blank (and appear different) moving forward. Whether it's actually different, may be a deeper UPDATE: - as per discussion with the team we will no longer support the NX2 behaviour; username and password will always be required and we just need to sort out the details to ensure that the model is consistent across CRUD operations. Acceptance criteria: - Password field should be required and styled as such in the UI. The new CMA default (host) repo creation has deployment policy set as read only. The NX2 default was dependant upon the release policy (disable redeploy for release, allow redeploy for snapshot, etc). After speaking with and this did not sound intentional so filing. These policies are new to CMA so no back checking of NX3 can be performed. Workaround to select what deployment policy is correct manually. This also affects the default NuGet hosted repo and caused me to find the related (linked) defect. UPDATE: - based on discussion during planning today we will leave the default as 'Disable redeploy' and it is already not read-only at this point.. Some pages actions have inconsistent masks. Elasticsearch seems to be more finicky that our data model allows right now, and likely spaces in Repository names is something we want to support. And after removing the space we find we don't allow uppercase letters: To reproduce just add a new Repository in the UI with a space or capital letter in the name. An unhelpful error is shown in the UI: ""Failed to start facets"" Minimally we should add validation to ensure that we don't allow invalid characters, as right now we end up with configured Repositories that cannot possibly function. Acceptance criteria: - names should be validated in the UI, and provide guidance when illegal names are tried - names should be validated on the server using the same rules as the abuse of the ExtDirect api) - names should only allow (English) alphanumeric and - names should be sanitized for elasticsearch usage in index names; this requires enforcing uniqueness of names as indexes are all lowercase.

Narrowing the search seems to give the correct results, making me wonder if searching the broader item is somehow including as something to be searched (though just for hosted as there are any number of proxied items with out there). This was untestable in NX3 because of NEXUS-9159, however, spoke with and decided to give it a distinct ticket rather than reopen that one soas not to cloudy the waters. Docker does not exist in NX2 so cannot be checked there. I am leaving this major as I can imagine this will render results less and less useful the more things you have in the hosted repo.

NOTE: - This may be due to the file stream not being closed properly - Maybe we are creating these files and not consuming, or a client network break - More than likely this is in P2 code Technical Direction: - Maybe look at the thread and see if it can be cleaned up?. Typically we build images tagged as ""latest"" after SCM change automatically in CI and we push them to registry. It is basically the same as with SNAPSHOT deployed by maven. As result there are many ""dangling"" images that in our case take significant amount of space. Usually when you re-build image, meaning you tag newly build image with an already existing tag, you will see ""dangling"" image in ""docker images"" output. And you would delete it with: Basically what we need is something similar to scheduled task named ""Remove Snapshots From Repository"" for removing old SNAPSHOTs deployed by maven. For example Docker registry V2, provides maintenance function called ""upload purging"" for this purpose. See I don't think that Nexus currently provides any means to removing those images. Am I right?. I noticed that if I publish then delete the related assets (via browse UI) and publish again that I am getting the below error. This happens despite allow redeploy being on. If I do not delete the republish works as does the first publish. Debug was off during this test. NPM is new to Fabtastic so no backcheck of NX3 is possible. I did not check NX2 at this time. WARN admin - Service failure null at Method) at Source) Source) at Method) at Source) Source) Method) at Source) at STEPS: 1) Setup NPM hosted repo 2) npm publish (I used my own creation, ala ) 3) Go to browse asset UI and delete all assets in the NPM hosted repo 4) npm publish; BUG: WARN in log, 500 on console, no republish is done. While reviewing NPM, I noticed looking at browse search results all the json details were smushed together making IMO a tough reading experience. In fact, I believe it's much easier to read the json file itself (the contents are the same but the are not stripped). noted that 'we implemented ""nice"" display of attributes only for 1 level' and if extended it would show nicer. He also noted that some docker attributes have the same issue. This is an improvement ticket in that regard. I included a screen of current npm as well as a screen of current NuGet (which looks much better; though not a fair comparison provides a vision of something to strive towards). NPM browse search is new to NX3 and to Fabtastic so no back checking was done. I do not recall seeing the docker portion myself (implemented in m5, new to NX3), so did not attach screens cases however if I run across it, I will try and remember to do so.. I noticed that after saving a Capability change on the Summary tab that the Save Discard buttons remain enabled. This does not happen on the Settings tab, so I surmise this may have been fixed one place (by ?) but not another. Similar tickets have definately existed (see some linked). There are no errors in the JS Debug was off during this test. I did not check older NX3 or NX2 at this time.. Acceptance Criteria: - Implement a separate ability to keep track of npm package document version Right now, the NPM specific document version field is getting populated with actual underlying (, which completely suites the use case. npm CLI does retries 3 times in case of MVCC conflict (client and server mismatch). Still, as per phone with Alin, this can lead to many false positives (unsuccessful edits and retries), due to the fact that will also modify so multiple clients one package, while one client trying to update it might lead that updating client fails (even after retries). Proper solution would be to implement ""manually"" NPM document versioning, it could be another NPM format specific asset attribute, maintained by NPM format code only. This way, we could circumvent also any future change that might spin faster than we currently expect.. See attached (from Blobstores page). On smaller columns in IE(11), the sort arrow collides with the text. I noticed this first on where the default column sizes are pretty small (lots of data) and the initial sort (Timestamp) is affected. This does not happen in Chrome (Windows7) so this seems to be an IE specific issue. Working browsers have the arrow on the right and if the column gets too small, not shown at all. Being that the sort arrow is not first and on the same line, this is what I would have expected. Workaround, widen the column. I am pretty sure I have seen this before but did not see a ticket. Did not test older NX3 or NX2 at this time. Debug was off during this test. NOTE: Maybe talk to Sencha about this one. The help text on routing rules is incorrect. It says that the path in the expression ""will include the repository name"". This is wrong. It also implies that a leading is needed in the path before the start of the group ID, this is also wrong. This was previously fixed in , so somehow this regressed.. Help text in routing rules is wrong. Steps to reproduce: - Nexus 3 - Adminstration - SSL Certificates - Load from server - (note that the port is missing so loading the cert will fail, but it is a valid hostname) - Loading dialog shows for a LONG time - you can navigate out of the view and 'Discard changes' - Loading dialog will continue to stay visible - Other views in UI are sort of accessbile but not really - Until the timeout happens some time later See attached video. The headers like Info and Attributes in Asset browsing have a black line on the left and top of the rows. They are not intended to be there. See attached screenshots. Also happens in Capabilities when editing a capability in the headers there. This happens in Google Chrome 45 on MacOSX with latest SNAPSHOT of Nexus as of today Pretty much same as M5. Confirmed to be a bug by Daniel via email.. Running ""update indexes"" by clicking within the ""browse"" storage tab of a repository does not work in Nexus The log shows that the path is incorrect: INFO admin - Scheduled task finished :: Updating repository index ""Releases"" from path and below. (started runtime Note that the path starts with "" content"". It should not. The request sent from the UI is correct, so this isn't a UI issue: - admin ""DELETE 204 0 6 I'm not sure exactly when this regressed, but the end user reported that it worked in and I can confirm, it did.. Theres a delete button when viewing an asset in a group repository. We dont support delete in that scenario, so the button shouldnt be there, and if we do try to use it an NPE is thrown since the Asset id doesn't exist in the group repo bucket. Acceptance Criteria: - Remove the button from group repositories! NOTE: - The information to remove this easily is not currently available, we'd have to figure something out to indicate your are in a group repository INFO admin - Deleting asset: null ERROR admin - Failed to invoke action method: java-method: null Method) at Source) at Source) Method). If you create a NPM proxy repository, and disable content validation via the UI, the which validates package content is not disabled. It seems like this validator should respect the content validation feature setting.. The maven component model contains and but it is missing This is a bug according to discussions with Jason. Currently, creation of the default blob store is lazy. This is a problem because (insert problem here). - Problem was went to look for Blob Store and it wasn't there yet! A new instance of Nexus should create the default file blob store as it starts up for the first time.. Deploy a site with an to a hosted raw repo with the Maven site deployment from Then navigating to the URL of the repo you see a 400 error in the Nexus UI Even though renders the site in HTML. Note: - Make sure we have a longer term plan for how we handle and directory. creates with while repositories created via UI have . I think we should decide which one is the default and go with that in both cases. Acceptance Criteria: - Set to true when default repos are created. If one is to add non proxy hosts - the tooltip (? icon) suggests regular expression Inserting a host with such format does not produce an error, but while having a wildcard '*' at the beginning of a hostname causes an error to show up in the console upon restart of Nexus. A correct regex patter should be something like: This correctly validates upon restart. Acceptance Criteria: - Change help text to correct pattern. The new jetty xml files in Nexus 3 are copies of those files found in Jetty These files contain system properties to simplify configuration of Jetty without the need to edit the xml files directly. Some of these properties are prefixed with some are not: When prefixed with jetty, it is very clear they are jetty container specific. When not, it is not clear if this applies to Jetty or something internal to Nexus. There is a chance of conflicts if we don't prefix all jetty properties. It would be more valuable to support when scanning support bundles to see what jetty properties are set when they are grouped alphabetically together as well. The only downside seems to be that we diverge from shipped default jetty xml files a bit. Personally not a concern with me as our files are bound to diverge in other ways regardless. Nexus jetty xml should be optimized for Nexus, not Jetty living in a vacuum. Acceptance: - prefix all container related ( jetty ) system properties with the text except well established Nexus properties like etc.. During UX review, I noticed that when you added a mark to the Log (via Viewer) that the modal that you use to add the mark gets a Saving mask. I had never seen a modal with a mask so asked Daniel and he asked me to file. He writes: ""This is a little odd, but the Add Mark modal is a bit of an odd-ball itself. Go ahead and file. Ill probably just move the mask to the log textarea field for I do not recall seeing this before but have not checked older versions of NX3 (or NX2) at this time. Note: - Just mask the entire UI. Timeout modal dialog does not appear sometimes (related JS error). Configure a hosted repository to allow yum metadata generation. Deploy an rpm into the hosted repository Configure a staging profile to allow yum metadata generation, and to release into the hosted repository used in step 1 Stage an rpm, then try to release it This will fail with a message like this: Artifact updating: Repository does not allow updating This is a regression, in the above scenario works without any problems. In Nexus if you try to release a staging repository that has yum metadata generation enabled it will fail if the target repository has a file in it already.. As a user, if I add columns to a results page, I would like them to remain that way at least for the duration of my session. While testing CLM, I searched and then added Security Issues and License Threat columns to see the results. Unsatisfied I did another search and noticed that those added columns were removed. I realized we just talked about this in a semi-recent meeting but did not see a ticket. I also assume this is behaving as desired and is not a bug. If I am wrong, please feel free to adjust the issue type. While my example was for search, I think this use case would be good for all pages. There was discussion about making this longer than a session, which would solve the minimal case I mentioned above. I did not test NX3 at this time because I believe search (specifically) is in flux. Note: - Could be a mixin that handles this Tech Direction: - Configure grids to be stateful. The forgot feature of Nexus can cause performance issues against an external realm. We should consider options such as: - optimizing the generic queries that the resource performs for external users - provide a configurable way to disable the feature - consider removing the feature entirely if that is easier - removing the Forgot Username and Forgot Password resource privs from the built in anonymous role. Acceptance Criteria: - Remove Forgot feature from UI. While reviewing NEXUS-7895, I noticed that the helper text for Evict Unused Proxied Items From Repository Caches task for the ""Evict items older than (days)"" was as attached but I felt grammatically wrong. After discussion with and , we decided to remove that helper text and instead change the title to ""Evict unused proxy items older than (days)"" (so it would encompass the elements of the helper text that were removed). I did not check NX2 at this time as I have been told to expect no UI changes for that. I did not check older versions of NX3 either. Acceptance Criteria: The title of Evict Unused Proxy Items will be ""Evict unused proxy items older than (days)"". While reviewing NEXUS-7760, I noticed I kept getting the attached warnings in my Safari Web Console once per browser session. I thought it might be search related but noticed that I also got it when I signed in and clicked Feeds and also when I clicked Standard (Repository; clicking Repositories was fine). The messages are the same each time. I do not notice anything errant on the pages but filing for investigation. Note: Do awful things to browser size to replicate this Acceptance Criteria: - Current missing assets will not show up in js console any longer when scrolling tabs. Oracle has started to publish a Maven repo with weblogic related artifacts. I expect that to become pretty popular with Oracle users since it saves TONS of time in terms of deploying the artifacts to an internal Nexus instance alternatively. We should make we know how to configure this so we can show customers and potentially work with Oracle to get any problems removed. More info: there might be no index. This could also be done as a blog post related investigation if there is no engineering. Update to more recent Groovy version. Groovy appears to be the latest available version with a corresponding groovy-eclipse compiler, with being the last release published at this time. Java 8 is only ""official"" since so hopefully this will head off any compatibility issues Acceptance Criteria: - Nexus 3 OSS and Pro will use Groovy. Implement Raw Format Proxy Repository For New CMA. Implement a simple bucket of files that allows for any file to be shared, so that they appear to be a repository while preserving the path. This is the simplest of the repo formats in Nexus. Equivalant of Site Repository from Nexus 2. We did this because Maven uploaded files such as HTML to describe your repo. This allows for to be shared.. Implement Raw Format For Hosted Under New CMA Architecture. As a Nexus administrator I want a supported procedure to rebuild the npm metadata from existing npm repository storage, particularly from hosted repositories. This is useful for rebuilding metadata from rsynced npm storage in a failover instance and as a database corruption recovery tool. Notes: - Look into OrientDB backup, export as potential options if we can't rebuild. As a user, it'd be nice to have a persistent message when I come back to a session and am logged out. Two times today, I've been idling on NX3 and on return to the screen have had a pause then realized I am logged out presumably due to idling. One benefit of NEXUS-7755 was that there was a history including that you were logged out. Right now, you can potentially just click anonymously before realizing what happened. Suggesting a message on the screen relaying you have been logged out that persists until the user clicks it off (or otherwise notes it as being seen). If NEXUS-7755 or like history is restored, then this could likely be OBE. Acceptance Criteria: - When a user is logged out due to timeout, show the user a dialog that indicates to them they have been logged out. Start with this repository setup: Configure your registry for to point at npm-group with proper permissions. Using and a proper publishConfig url in deploy package X version to npm-hosted1 deploy package X version to npm-hosted2 Execute This returns one version . Reorder the group members: Execute This returns one version ( ). Expected - should list all versions of the same package in all group members Notes: - NPM groups do not exactly match up with Maven groups packages are flat, there is no hierarchy Because of this, should we treat NPM groups like Maven groups? We have a concern that we could merge packages together due to the flat nature of NPM that weren't meant to be merged Scoped packages was invented to circumvent this problem Potentially do: - Allow for capability for specific groups to do merge, and instruct the users on how to add hosted proxy repos to the group. Replace modello based LDAP configuration with orient db Acceptance Criteria: - Remove Plexus based Unit Tests -. This has someting to do with re-using settingsforms bits which have this preset width. Acceptance Criteria: - Bring Change Password Dialog into being a consistent width with Login Dialog. Content from sources needs to be able to detect the type, by asking Tika and recoding this in metadata. Additional logic will also be needed to layer ontop to validate that content we get is what we think, to cope with issues like asking for a .jar file and getting a .html error page. Acceptance Criteria: - You will be able to deploy a Maven site to a hosted raw repo and when viewing it in the browser it will display properly due to content types being returned. NuGet Proxy Repository. As a .NET developer, so that I can get quicker and more reliable access to remote packages, I want the ability to have NuGet repos cached locally Acceptance Criteria: - Implement handlers for the various read-only NuGet gallery protocol endpoints (ODATA queries, downloading, - Implement the caching of components in component storage. - If a user requests a package we don't have by URL we should send a request to fetch the metadata from the remote proxy - Feed counts should reflect what the upstream repo reports results will be slightly different due to the algorithms we use versus - If the remote repo goes down, a user should be able to still use the proxy repo with locally available metadata and packages - Locally cached NuGet packages should be visible in Nexus ElasticSearch results - Nexus Admins will be able to configure the cache duration size for queries to remote repos so that we don't overload the remote repo - If a user Searches on the NuGet Feed search results are capped at 40 entries - Supported clients are Visual Studio 2013's package manager, the VS package manager powershell utility, the standalone command-line client, and the Nuget Package Manager.. Acceptance Criteria: - Add and test support for the ability to use the npm deprecate command to deprecate a package - Add and test support for the ability to use the npm deprecate command to UNdeprecate a package - Visually show that the package has been deprecated in Search and Browse This is the alternative for npm unpublish ( NEXUS-6892 ).

We should consider options such as: - optimizing the generic queries that the resource performs for external users - provide a configurable way to disable the feature - consider removing the feature entirely if that is easier - removing the Forgot Username and Forgot Password resource privs from the built in anonymous role. Acceptance Criteria: - Remove Forgot feature from UI (just remove the js code). Enable User Token and the Protect Content feature. When a request is made to a content path with valid credentials that are not Nexus user token credentials, Nexus responds with 401, but no entity explaining why. Problems: - the end user is confused, because they know they have entered technically valid organization credentials. - the Nexus admin is confused because they either have forgotten about or were not the ones who setup the Protect Content feature, or just assume protecting content is a good idea, so leave the box enabled. - the Protect Content feature is valuable, but it is a rather odd special case that affects all realms in Nexus because of the special Token it creates internally, so an administrator is not reminded it may be in play because it is not near where all the other realms are configured - a Nexus admin must enable DEBUG and TRACE logs to see why there was a 401, assuming they can even understand what loggers to enable and what to look for Improvement: Simple continue to respond with 401, but include a simple message body explaining the reasoning - that user token credentials are being enforced in Nexus.

Request this URL through a NuGet proxy repository of The outbound request made is this: A 200 response is received with XML describing the artifact, but then no request is made for this: If you then enable ""fetch all versions"" in the ""download nuget feed"" and make the original request again it will work. I'm not sure why this is necessary since the path is the same, and Nexus knows that the artifact exists due to the first request's return value.. Include staging database details into support-zip. With the move to nosql db for staging, we have lost the ability to include the in support-zip.. Nexus has 2 LDAP plugins one for OSS and one for PRO. We should remove the OSS plugin and move the PRO plugin to OSS. Including all of the tests, etc. Can probably leave the packagenames asis, unless we feel its better to rename those to at this time?

The deployment policy should be smart enough to not worry about the metadata files I think (just a guess).. Remove deprecated Task from NX3. Currently it is possible to enable YUM support (and in fact it is enabled by default in pro) even if no createrepo command is found. This can lead you down the track of configuring stuff for yum support and filling up the logs with exceptions that no createrepo command was found. It would be better to simply disable the capability if no command is found and not allow enabling it either, and instead presenting a useful error message in the UI that says you need to have createrepo and mergerepo on the path (and probably therefore run on It should probably look for the mergerepo command as well..

Acceptance criteria: There's a standard spot in asset metadata for storing these hashes * Wire it up so that Raw and Simple assets record these actual hashes (as opposed to ways of obtaining the expected hashes, which should also eventually be stored). Implement a repository which proxies a remote HTTP site and stores any files (of any format) in the CMA repository storage facet. Only GET requests are honored (others are rejected).

Given an org configures an http proxy server to access certain hosts only And Nexus is configured with this http proxy server And GET requests to a nuget proxy repository hosted in Nexus have to follow a redirect to a different host than the host they proxy in order to download an artifact When the artifact is downloaded through Nexus and the http proxy server responds with 403 because access to that host is not allowed Then Nexus should respond to the original request with 403 And the response should include the possible reason of the 403 ( source proxy server was used, the redirected to host used and that the routing through it failed with 403) Nexus currently responds with 404 and no reason to the NuGet client. This leads a Nexus admin to turn on Nexus DEBUG logging to see redirection failure instead of client user knowing they need to configure the Nexus HTTP proxy server to allow certain hosts.

325,nexus,mcculls,"A comment with security level 'Developers' was removed.. improve use and performance implications. Currently we disallow fetching of tarballs from incomplete NPM packages, where a package is considered as incomplete if it has at least one version which doesn't define a tarball distribution. We should instead just disallow fetching of tarballs whose specific version is incomplete, rather than ban the whole package whose versions might all be complete except for one incomplete version. Recreate instructions: Accessing chokidar package root should pass: curl ' Accessing chokidar package root should now fail: curl ' * Accessing chokidar tarball should also fail: Original cause: the npmjs registry root declares basic version metadata for all packages, and Nexus distributes this partial metadata across the package roots when the registry root is fetched. If you then request a particular package root (say chokidar) Nexus will overlay the full package metadata with the partial metadata from the registry root. For almost all packages this means that the partial version metadata from the registry root is replaced with full version metadata from the package root. However, the chokidar and phantomjs packages each have a version listed in the registry root that doesn't appear in their package root. This leaves an incomplete version in the merged package root, which then causes nexus to fail to serve any tarballs from that package. Acceptance test: with this fix these last two failures are fixed.. At the moment we always merge the downloaded package root with previously cached content. This can end up leaving bad entries in the cache even after they have been removed from the upstream proxy. See NEXUS-8625 for more details about the original cause of the bad metadata. We should instead replace the cached content with the downloaded content.. support distinct artifactMaxAge and metadataMaxAge settings in NPM. See NEXUS-8221 and NEXUS-8178 The bad checksums are based on the first 8 bytes of the item plus the full content of the item. The task should search the item context and attributes for checksums that match and regenerate them.. Create a task to find and fix bad checksums affected by the extra link detection check. Note: databases created by OrientDB are compatible with OrientDB. Typos in ""Smart Proxy: File Event Sink"" capability About. Update the example email address. provide a method to rebuild the npm metadata from storage data for hosted repositories. CLM server password is not removed from support tool zip configuration. Querying NuGet proxy with no $top parameter causes excessive caching. I noticed this when manually testing NuGet with curl. The code that runs the new pass-through queries against the NuGet proxy will automatically page through all results that match the query rather than stop at the first page. This means that if you get the ""Packages"" feed using curl with no query parameters it will attempt to page through the entire NuGet proxy feed and not come back for several minutes. This could explain the longer query times occasionally observed in the field, because we'll be fetching all matching entries rather than stopping at the first page of results. However, the next time the query is run it would be faster because we've pre-fetched all subsequent pages. If possible we should take exactly what's returned from the NuGet upstream feed and not follow ""next page"" references. This should just be a matter of tweaking the feed scraper..

There is unsynchronized write access to the private member variable in Threads are likely backing up within the call in this method that is made to false ) - assuming that is synchronized deeper in the call stack - which would cause repetitive reassignment of the targets and potentially behavior with multiple threads calling concurrently. I don't know that this explains the NPE but that certainly seems plausible. Also, it is also possible for a thread calling to possibly skip the entire ""if"" block associated with the null condition for and creating the collection to be returned from a partially configured set of Target instances. This latter situation does not seem as though it would generate the NPE though. This does not appear to be a regression and is probably the result of the addition of the new repos for Scala Tools. This also seems like it may require a potentially precarious fix with the addition of the necessary locking. The urgency of this for OSSRH is probably somewhat high as the configuration is changed quite often and the number of repositories is high. (This needs to be validated) If staging actions by users cause the configuration to be reloaded, this is very likely to be a hot spot.

Work was done as part of: NXCM-3492 to figure out how to make the proxy attributes faster. We came to the conclusion that this is NOT the best place to optimize. However there are a few things we could do to improve performance. One of the standouts is change the to only be updated every 12 hours (this time may change, but will be somewhere between 12 and 24) This should NOT be configurable via the UI, but we should consider keeping it as a system property.

In the source we note we may want to use a SplitView on Windows 10: and I think we have the choice of all three on Windows 10, so we may want to see which is the best fit.. Our current implementation is ""turned of""' for because the API doesn't exist. The API does exist in Windows 10, but since I wrote most of the code before we started out real efforts, I did not finish it fully. We need to fully hook it up (particularly, we don't actually generate a ContactList on the Windows side when we do a so any operations on the js group returned won't work.. The bundled make in Windows SDK has a set of default assets it packages apps with. One of those is a temporary PFX key. However, they only auto-insert it if the app has no apps manifest, but we generate that. So we need to add logic that for not distribution targets that require PFX cert we should just use the temporary key transparently much as Visual Studio does. So for ws-local on and for wp-emulator, ws-local, wp-device on when no PFX is found, use this key and don't prompt.. Using this code: The textfield ""password"" don't mask the content if field is not editable. If property editable is set to true, the value is masked. Works fine on iOS devices.. Windows: Can't display local url on windows phone. We currently use macros that will effectively compile one block or another depending on whether the code works is available on phone or desktop. This is the right approach for Windows 8, but in Windows 10 a universal app is generated and the check must be done at runtime. We need to convert these checks into a macro and have the macro defined to do different things for versus 10. See and I think we can extract a simple macro like: We may of course need more variants for things where the API is now available in Win10, but was only available for phone or store on etc. Clipboard was only for in but is universal in 10). Windows: Convert (store or phone only) code to using macros to guard. When we target Windows 10 as the end SDK target for a user's app, we need to be sure we use the Win10 compiled SDK libraries.. We have separate builds of the SDK done against Win and Win 10. We need to package both versions up into a single zip that is used in the main SDK. We can't just mash together the two zips, as we need to adjust where the WIn10 builds get packaged up in the final zip. Right now they're under store x86 and store ARM. They probably should be under something like ""win10 x86"" and win10""ARM"" since they're supposed to be universal for Win10 store phone.. If we generate a native UI proxy (say an and add it to a Titanium UI, we don't properly clean up all the native proxies we've generated leading to a large memory leak. Specifically we need a way to track all UI proxies added as children in the view hierarchy and explicitly release them when the top-level native view is asked to release in our Java code. Be able to pass in some subclass of into Titanium methods that take subclasses. Once the V8 library is updated we'll need to do some significant work to update our native C++ code. There have been a number of large breaking API changes in V8 that we'll need to handle. See:. Add some mechanism to reference, include and use third-party libraries in Hyperloop JS code.. Android: Support usage of third-party JARs in Hyperloop. Support some syntax that allows users to implement a native interface in Hyperloop JS.. Support some syntax that allows users to subclass existing native types in Hyperloop JS.. Tried doing this (had to use JDK8), and got the following: It appears there are at least a few issues to resolve.. If you're using native API access and create something like a you'd naturally want to set a text label for the button. But the Content property is a with the understanding it could be a String or it could be an UIElement (in fact it could be a UIElement, and if it's not then it's basically converted to a String though how that's done isn't really talked about). We need to understand this nuance of the API and support settings string values easily,. Windows: Implement. If any of the app icons are missing, then search for and and us it to generate missing app icons. You simply need to the base Builder object's method: Here's a good article on MSDN about the assets for Windows apps:. Windows: ti build failed when logo image assets with invalid dimension exits.

If the sample needs to be updated in any way (like enabling capabilities), file a PR for the sample.. If a developer uses the native wrappers they currently cannot generate native UI components and then add those to a Titanium View Window, and vice versa. We should support the ability to wrap native UI widgets as when necessary, or unwrap native components to native wrappers when necessary. This is something Pedro's handles.. We have a version of hard-coded into the manifest templates. We need to pass along the tiapp version number to the manifest. From the looks of it, I think the best approach is to use the first two digits from tiapp, and then we should manage the last two. The 3rd one should be an number each build. The 4th can likely just be a unix timestamp.. Windows: Module name suggestion should include text description, not just a regular expression for format. Windows: does not work. Windows: Adding items to a ListSection after creation of ListView doesn't update UI. In testing the RSS Reader sample, I'm seeing nothing happen once we do get the RSS feed fetched. Once I loaded everything up in Debug mode in VS2013, I see the following logs when it should be showing the new items in the ListView: Basically, our code works fine if all the items are created first, then added to sections, then the ListView is created from the pre-populated section. But if you generate a ListView with one section, and add items to it later async, nothing actually happens visually. We haven't hooked all that code up to do anything. We have methods for modifying the sections on a view, and I think that should work fine post-create, but the item manipulation at the section level just never triggers the view to add them..

Windows: does not return correct values. Windows: Update and properties on CI build. This looks to be a mismatch in our implementation with the way the property is defined. We ask the current position status, but that value isn't ""good"" unless there's an active tracking session. The property is meant to convey if the app itself is set up to do location services, so it's more a check if they've set the in their I'm not sure if we can query capabilities at runtime or not. We might be able to do a simple call to the geolocator and catch exceptions to know if this property should be true or false.. The docs we use to populate the parity report (or maybe just the parity report itself?) aren't including the Windows specific types we've introduced. Specifically, we have a set of types implemented, but not listed in the parity report. I also don't see them listed in the bleeding edge docs at The types are here:. Windows: Fire routechange event. Windows: Add windows module build command to the CLI. Add the ability to build a windows module project from the CLI. Windows: Add windows module create command to the CLI. We should allow hooking and removing event handlers in a JS-like fashion and handling the conversion to the right native calls in native wrappers. We'll need to do some translation of event names and also mapping to various handlers event registration types that Windows uses, as well as wrap the added handler with a call to the callback function.. We need a mechanism as part of the build to crawl the user's app to generate the list of native types required. We may need to also handle ""dynamic"" requires and treat them as needing all native types. We can then use this list of types and their dependencies to trim down the list of included types we'd incorporate into the require and cast hooks from TIMOB-18878 and TIMOB-18879.. Implement the non create* methods: -beep -hideCamera -previewImage -showCamera -switchCamera -takePicture -vibrate. Windows: Allow casting to a different native type. We should allow the ability to ""upcast"". We could simply hang a ""JSObject type)"" method that is on all native wrapped objects and would take the new type name. Then we'd have a giant generated if else block where we test against the known set of type names and do the to ""cast"" it:. Windows: Stub module with constants, stubs for methods, no event firing.

We should use a fully implemented algorithm for our require implementation that generally follows the spec: Tony L has implemented on top of Titanium APis for and Jeff H implemented in Objective-C. We also had an impl in Hyperloop, all of which we can try and re-use leverage.. we seem to do this pattern a lot where we pull something out of a argument list, cast it, check the type via assertion, etc. this is a good place to come up with either an inlined helper function or a macro. makes the code more readable and has the advantage for developers to ensure we have a very common pattern for how to do this logic. From Jeff's review comments here:. I would create macro that does this instead: which would generate this: From Jeff's review comments here:. HAL: Create helper for common property additions to classes. Can't we come up with something like this: This would generate: Advantage is that we force a compile time pattern for the TitaniumKit defined interfaces and it's easier later if we want to change the pattern or add assertions or even compile this code out with our compiler because this method isn't used by the app. From Jeff's review comments here:. Windows: Need to support UTF-8 characters. Related to PR 12 ( Added new issue entry for this so that we can track this. We may need a workaround for Currently some unit tests are failing on Yosemite.

We package up an ini file into the apps with the IP port to use to connect to the CLI and forward logs.

Same goes for when the ListView is removed from its parent view while the SearchBar has focus, so that seems to be the actual problem. The crashlog is attached. h1. Test case 1 1. Install an app with the following code on an iPad (crashes on iOS Simulator as well, but doesn't show crashlog) 2. Tap the button 3. Tap the searchbar to focus 4. Tap outside the popover to hide it 5. App crashes after a second or so h1. Test case 2 1. Install an app with the following code on an iOS device (crashes on iOS Simulator as well, but doesn't show crashlog) 2. Tap the searchbar to focus 3. Tap the button to remove the ListView 4. App crashes after a second or so. A few weeks ago I started noticing that a lot of apps where I used complex and layouts were showing their children before they were layed out. I made a simple test case that showed this has been the case since and is not related to iOS 8 which I first assumed. In some occasions I've (as well as Jason) have seen the children not being layed out at all! h2. Test case Run the following test case again Titanium or later: h2. Attached videos The movies I recorded show clearly that the children show center-top (except the first label which has before being layed out at their proper place.

The problem Both of these guides at themselves work just fine. But when you follow both of them you'll get the problem described. h1. Steps to reproduce 1. Download the attached example project 2. Build to see the expected white application window 3. Rename to 4. Build to see the white application window in the top left h1. Explored solutions I've tried several changes such as using instead of or setting the splash in a custom theme, but nothing helped. I also compared the builds after step 2 and 4 of the steps laid out to reproduce. All the (non-binary) files were 100% identical, so the error must be in the compiled JAVA and not in the generated XML themes. h1. Workaround I can't think of a (satisfying) workaround, so I hope this can be fixed soon.. iOS: No event generated on click of map annotation title or subtitle. h5.

Removing from review for now. iOS: Support ""keypressed"" event. iOS: Change documentation on. Github recently published a new feature to create issue- and PR-templates for community contributions. In our case, we would be able to inform the user about the coding guidelines for extending the SDK, the CLA link, the necessary docs etc. For issues, we could mention to create a JIRA ticket first, attach build logs and provide the environment. The required files ( and ) are placed inside a .github directory. More information:. To support Hyperloop modules, developers need to access common Ti-utilities like we already do with . Common used classes: - TiUtils - WebColor - WebFont Problem to discuss is also: What do we do for existing modules that want to be migrated to Hyperloop? They often rely on existing proxies (although not recommended).. Hyperloop: Expose builtin utilities. Using the new property introduced by TIMOB-18515 you get strange behaviour when you play with to not only reposition but also enlarge the icon: The icon resizes when you the tab. And when you repeatedly tap on the icon it will continue to grow. See the attached video. While the behavior is native, we should only allow the and property to calculate the negative and automatically.. Not sure how to proper name this ticket, but it's something with the going wrong. So whenever we want to create a proxy or inside a callback of a (and probably other async callbacks), the proxy cannot be found and it throws the attached error. Example: The example will crash as soon as the callback is invoked. If we call it directly, the app wont crash. Note: The warning is logged before the crash. So it might be related to TIMOB-20397, although the gets initialized correctly with .. iOS: Main-Thread: Cannot create proxies in callbacks. Hyperloop: Couldn't find iOS CocoaPods with ""-"". iOS: Support SearchBar button title. iOS: Resolve Xcode compiler warnings. As part of the major release we should set the minimum Xcode version from to and remove the macros to cleanup the code base.. iOS introduces some new API's of the framework: - - - - - - - - That will simply result in new events to be used to check the session state from the main application.. iOS: not being fired. Android: Updated AttributeProxy to allow fontStyle to be set without having fontWeight to be manually set.. iOS: Support (aka Blur View). We should support the aka Blur View introduced in iOS 8 as a public API (instead of unrecommended solution of stretching a toolbar). Demo architecture:. For the release we should clean up the namespace and move components, that are also available on the iPad, to instead and deprecate the old ones: : - moved to (TIMOB-19522) - to - to - in removed since - to - to - to - to - to - to - to - to - to - to - to : - to - to - in deprecated since replaced with ""fullscreen"" on window - in deprecated since replaced with on window - to : - -. iOS: Support for `selected` event on TabGroup when tab already selected. Android: Add support for style in. The current implementation works. But to make it even more efficient related to memory management, I refactored a few parts: - Remove manual properties of inside the and access them through the property (since the delegate is not public and it keeps the object dependencies clean) - Release some properties that have not been released before - Add missing code docs in the header file - Change counter index from to and remove unused property that have been used during testing - Enable ARC in all related files (!) Demo code (should work exactly like before):. iOS: from webView is not working. iOS: Improve deprecation macros.

Currently we need to disable iOS9 App Transport Security (ATS) in the builtin KitchenSink whenever we want to test any ticket related to webview, httpclient, etc. As we disable ATS in our SDK as well, we should change this setting in the of the Xcode project. The image loads. An ATS error is thrown:. iOS: ListView separator has huge margins on iOS 9. iOS: Sample app crashes on start with SQLite error related to analytics. We used to have a property, that was removed as part of the release in around changes with non-attached images. The say, the property was already removed in but worked until I would like to get this property back to achieve a proper behavior in the following use case. : Use to make an image (blob) of a view, that covers a specified square inside another view. : The method works same on retina and non-retina devices. The method uses the wrong scale on creating the image blob. : Bring back the property, make the default value to as the current behavior expects. That would achieve the configuration of the property, but would not break any existing applications.. iOS9 offers a new return key to show a ""Continue"" button. We should support it and provide a fallback for older devices. Also, we should support the two missing keyboards for twitter and websearch. :. iOS9: Support ""Continue"" return key + new keyboard types. Support PHLivePhoto + PHLivePhotoView. iOS provides a way to receive, display and share live photos using the related classes. A live photo is a photo, that consists of several photos taken together as frames but it still is no video. It can be displayed using the and managed through the or (which we use). Summarized, our proposal should be: b) allow developers to display live photos in a new view proxy or directly in the existing using auto detection on the image source type.. iOS: ImageViews with remote images slow and failing. iOS: TableView header has wrong default height. Apple just presented the new 3D-Touch feature of the iPhone6S.

UIPickerView and UIDatePicker are now resizable and these views would enforce a default size even if you attempted to resize them. These views also now default to a width of 320 points on all devices, instead of to the device width on iPhone. Interfaces that rely on the old enforcement of the default size will likely look wrong when compiled for iOS 9. Any problems encountered can be resolved by fully constraining or sizing picker views to the desired size instead of relying on implicit behavior. Demo code: On iOS8, nothing should change and the height is ignored. On iOS9, the height should be honored and the picker should resize.. Via the new property behavior, iOS9 now allows keyboard input as an action on the lock screen. Reference: Sample code:. A bit more context: The property works for local notifications, but not for remote notifications. But it also seems, like other properties like , that have been there before, don't show up, too..

Currently, we are using image files, copied into an assets catalog named LaunchImage for the launch screens. There is a newer method supported in Xcode 6 iOS8 and greater, whereby you can have a file, in which you can configure the launch screen, and it's adaptable to all device types. We need this file to exist in order for slideView splitView to work on iOS9. Similar to what we did with watchos2, we need work flow to be as such: 1. CLI generate an Xcode project template that contains a sample LaunchImage file. (ti create launchScreen) 2. Ti developer does what he wants in that Xcode project, very likely with an assets catalog in it as well. 3. when calling ti build, CLI copies this storyboard file and well as any associated image sets in the assets catalog into the build project. 4. will also need this so we either include automatically or have the Ti developer include it in Note: The existence of will make Xcode ignore the original LaunchImage asset catalog.

Because IPv6 support is so critical to ensuring your applications work across the world for every customer, we are making it an AppStore submission requirement, starting with iOS h4. Quote from link Three steps all developers can take to make sure their applications work over IPv6 networks: - Use the networking frameworks (for example, - Avoid use of IPv4-specific APIs - Avoid hard-coded IP addresses Essentially, if app developers are using the higher level APIs and frameworks and arent hacking around at the IP layer, their apps should probably just work on top of either IPv4 or IPv6. This is an important point most iOS developers probably do not need to do anything on the development side. Assuming they have followed best practices in coding and are using the iOS networking frameworks, they should be all set. Some developers, though, may be using lower level APIs that may involve direct usage of IPv4 addresses. Some developers may also be using the users IPv4 address as an identifier or for logging or configuration purposes. But again, most iOS developers probably dont need to change their code to support IPv6. Apple Guide:.

A short writeup is here: Apple has added notification action support so that user can immediately handle notifications in the home screen or lock screen, without the user having to enter the app. To enable this for both local and remote notifications, the following steps have to followed: 1. Create and Configure Notification Actions 2. Create and assign Notification Actions to Notification Categories 3. Register the Notification Categories and Notification Types 4. After which, add event listeners for notifications received while the app is active, or in background. key parameters: activation Mode: determines where app should be activated when user selects this action destructive: if this action does something permanent like delete if this action needs user to enter pin to continue key parameters: default actions to show. Will show all if user has set app to display notifications in alert style. : actions to show when user has set app to display notifications in banner style, and in lock screen. Note: categories: nil will allow local notifications to work without actions Note: To enable interactive remote notifications, steps 1 to 3 should be done as well. Followed by Require ACS to add additional field ""category"" to aps push packet, so that we can enable this for remote notifications.. The Titanium iOS SDK should have 0 static analyzer errors (it currently has 77). The static analyzer is very accurate and every issue identified by it should be corrected.

If you have a .png image in your Resources dir that is actually a .gif but with the wrong extension, pngcrush will blow up and the build will fail. Depending on your luck, you will either get no error or a file rename error. pngcrush returns 0 if crushing fails, which is probably a bug with pngcrush (or at least the one shipped with Xcode 7). The rename error happens because pngcrush take the input file and writes the crushed png to another file and the iOS build needs to rename it back to the correct filename. If the temporary crushed png image was never generated, then there's nothing to rename and then it blows up. It's worth noting that in Titanium SDK and older, the iOS build called . This is a perl script that converts plists into binary format and crushes pngs. The problem with this script is if pngcrush fails, it aborts the entire script and returns 0. This is bad. A) this potentially does not optimize several unprocessed PNG images and B) doesn't return an error code. So, this image optimization has been silently failing for years..

Add an event to the button which fires the following code: Reopen the app (so the views get added again), browse to the 3rd view and click the button. It will throw this exception: How i've solved it: Before removing the ScrollableView views, i've used this method:. Steps to reproduce: Create a PickerColumn with 9 PickerRows and add it into the Picker. Try setting your PickerColumn height or width to double its size: it gets worse. The selection indicator always shows 2 rows below what is currently selected. In the image below the first 3 picker columns are selecting the first row (0), but what is actually being shown is that the 2 is selected. The 4th column selecting the last row (9), but what is being shown is that white space. !Screen Shot at What i've tried: Tested on both android (simulator) and (real device) * Setting each picker row's height doesn't change anything.

This task involves both the initial refactoring, as well as re-integrating it back into and. Android: Refactor androidlib. Adding Environment functionality: 3 Adding Xcode functionality: 5 Launching simulator Stopping simulator Bring back into Titanium CLI: 8 * Bring back into tiO2: 3. Android SDK not loading due to EPERM failure. iOS: URLSession Module returns blob instead of file location - causing low memory crash. Android: contentOffset property of not accessible. iOS8: Support iOS 8. Android: App crashes when using searchBar border properties. App crashes if we use the searchBar properties borderRadius, borderColor, or borderWidth. And use this searchBar in a tableView using search property. Environment: Titanium SDK: Titanium CLI: Android SDK: OS X Version: Appcelerator Studio: to Reproduce the issue: 1. Create classic project. 2. Paste this code file. 3. Run this code with the testing environment. Code Thanks. Android: Android menuItem with actionView can't handle. Android KS- Facebook crashes. Android KS- Photo Gallery crashes. Here is why and how it can be fixed. I debugged why autoRedirect property of is ignored for The default property of autoRedirect is true. When autoRedirect false is set, is always zero in Therefore the redirect check if statement if && ! 0) does always fall through. ; needs to be called in advance. Android: TIME Picker is too small when useSpinner is set to true. CLI: Windows 7 hangs on build during ""Powershell"" detection. When you try to perform a ""ti build"", the process hangs (0% of CPU) forever. After hours of debugging (with I discover an issue in the module. Basically the 'spawn' uted (line 385) to detect the powershell, for odd reasons, never emits the 'close' event and so the process hangs. Skipping this detection, the build continue normally. I have described in more details the problem in the following post: Not sure why this happens, but I'm not the only one with this issue.. iOS8: not working properly. iOS8: KitchenSink: Views Options Dialog: Pop up does not show up on iPad. iOS8: Orientation: Screen gets distorted when orientation changes. In addition to the X and Y properties, views in the Android L Developer Preview have a Z property. This new property represents the elevation of a view, which determines: The size of the shadow - Views with higher Z values cast bigger shadows. The drawing order - Views with higher Z values appear on top of other views. We could use this instead of sorting the views manually like we do now.. The material theme provides a new style for your app, system widgets that let you set their color palette, and default animations for touch feedback and activity transitions.. description The developer's app includes a Ti module that wraps a 3rd-party library that uses the iOS Reachability class. It appears that APSAnalytics also uses the iOS Reachability class. Both the 3rd-party library and the APS system include this class in their respective libraries causing a duplicate symbol error during linking. Below is the error I get when manually building the app:. iOS: Duplicate symbol linker error when using APS. h5. Description: Ritu experienced an issue during update to GA components which resulted in her ti config JSON getting corrupted. The cause or timing of this are not known. No other team members experienced it during our update testing, so at this point seems isolated to a single system. When a project is created in Studio in this configuration, the is not rendered correctly. In addition all commands for the CLI fail, see below for details: To fix the issue, the JSON structure was manually edited to be valid. h5. Steps to reproduce: Steps are mostly unknown, but have more detail on config Configure a system in the following manner: One latest development version of the SDK in your titanium folder, but no GA Latest modules from a previous development build install Studio Latest version GA npm components (acs CLI Alloy Check for Appcelerator updates in studio Update your NPM components and SDK Check in terminal ""ti config"" h5. Result: JSON structure is invalid, and the CLI is unable to parse. CLI commands fail, and Studio editor fails to render (since components are missing from CLI-built project) h5. Expected Result: CLI identifies bad structure and offers information on solution. iOS8: Add support for Share Extensions. CLI: fails to build to device with Android. Crittercism: iOS crashes do not show up with module. Android: Animation is broken if you don't stringify the affected view. iOS8: Add support for Interactive Notifications. h4.

The map never ask for permission for the GPS access, not even if the user presses the location icon google will briefly flash ""Location could not be identified"" h4. Extra information Use case: When we open a html5 page that as a geolocation titanium does not give access to GPS on the device.. Android: Geolocation is not turning on in Webview. TiAPI: Add support to HTTPClient for PATCH requests. CLI: Android: Ti SDK picks up the latest incompatible version of the map module. 1. In the manifest file of map module change the minsdk to (this is because map module does not build with & throws errors). 2. Use SDK and build an app which has map implementation in it. Result: 1. Even though studio does not show map module in the module list, the SDK CLI picks up the incompatible version & throws errors: Result: 1. The SDK CLI should pick up the latest compatible version of the map module build.. iOS: Search disappears from ListView. Android: LiveView throws errors if action bar is implemented in the app. I am using web view in my alloy application to render charts using RGraph HTML5 library. My code works perfectly fine on iOS.

The reason why is because we don't put the directory inside the app root directory like we do for iOS. Instead, it's in an adjacent directory to the app root directory. In other words, it's however it's not accessible because apps can't leave the app root directory. There's no way for an app to access module assets from a Titanium app. The only way I've heard is you have to use write another module that effectively proxies the assets. It gets worse, modules paths are not namespaced like on iOS. So if has a file called and also has a they collide and only one of the files will exist. Yes, this is really bad design. Yes, these are bugs. Yes, they should be fixed.. CLI: Improve detection of Android SDK and SDK Home locations. BlackBerry: 'java' processes belonging to 'Appcelerator Studio' might kill the CPU.

Blobs are primarily used to wrap native data structures or sources (ex: file descriptor, image, buffers). The goal of this ticket is just implement the proxy front facing APIs. Internally it should be architected to support wrapping various data sources. For the initial implementation support ""buffer"" based blobs would be a good first step. Blobs are not creatable, but returns by various API methods in Titanium. For testing this ticket implement the method. This should return a Blob which should allocate a buffer and copy the data over. Blob streams and to image conversions will not be implemented at this time. Separate tickets for those will be created. h3. Acceptance Test Look into using the test in Anvil for Blobs.

Related to TISTUD-998, right now in Studio you can select (some of) the properties of an AVD (Run- Run Android Emulator) but this isn't configurable enough for some cases (although you can modify an AVD created by Studio in the tools, as long as it has the right name). It would be nice to have the feature to select a pre-existing AVD in the run so that you can use an existing AVD without having Studio create a new one for you. It appears to require build script modifications allowing for the specification of an arbitrary AVD.. Android: JSS with import and js with include files not working. Android: should accept an alias password. iOS: Support building to device, directly to the device, skipping iTunes. When building to device, it would be good to build directly to the device rather then building, then having to sync via iTunes. Here is a good jumping off point: For those people who wish to sync to iTunes, we will inject a fake ""device ID"" that represents iTunes Sync and this will revert to using the existing mechanism..

This is preventing Titanium from creating the Android AVDs needed to test apps, giving the following error: Error: is not recognized as a valid sdcard value. It looks like the command that creates the avd is stripping away part of the string when it tries to create an avd. I've manage to track down a function 'create avd' in which I think may be the culprit, but I'm not sure where to go from there. The sdcard has been created, so the problem must be after that point. There are a multitude of methods for renaming the user folder, none of which are straight forward (registry edits, I'm hoping someone can tell me a way of making Titanium function with this, albeit rare and idiotic, usage case.

For the device, the keyboard is not rendered correctly during rotation (see TIMOB 8363) On when starting with the soft keyboard on screen, on orientation change, the keyboard animates off-screen then is redrawn after the UI has handled the orientation change. This occurred on both portrait to landscape and landscape to portrait orientation changes. On iPod the same behavior like on iPod but this occurs only when making a portrait to landscape orientation change. For landscape to portrait orientation changes, the soft keyboard does not leave the screen during the orientation change, it simply rotates with the other UI elements. Steps to reproduce: 1) Using SDK build and install KS 2) Bring up the soft KB 3) Rotate the device Result: All devices show unique behavior, but in general there is a KB redraw. The older behavior was that the KB stayed on screen and rotated with the UI. Expected: The KB stays on screen and rotates with the UI. Notes: Does not occur with. ",12,936,5515

If a user uploads a file and aborts the upload multiple times ram usage becomes very high and will cause the app to crash. This did not happen with the ram would get cleared when the upload was aborted. When watching instruments while preforming a upload you can watch ram using spike on each upload but never be released. h4. Steps to reproduce 1. Create new mobile project (classic titanium) 2. Please copy the Attached file to the Resources directory. 3. Paste the Sample Code to ( to test with large upload file that will automatically abort after seconds) :. h4. Problem Description There is a new WebView for iOS 8 that it's a lot faster than the WebView. It might be useful to provide a better experience to the end users. h4. Extra info h4.

Create new mobile project (classic titanium) 2. Copy this code into 3. Run it in device.. h4. Problem Description On Android, saves a file or a blob without any file extension, which makes it impossible for the photo gallery to recognize the file.

I receive a success, but the image is saved without extension and I get this message in the console: action: path: h4. Steps to Reproduce: 1. Create a Classic project. 2. Paste this code in file. 3. Paste a photo to the resources folder named 4. Run this code with the testing environment. Code:. Android: Android ListView is not exposed in Titanium. h4. Problem Description When a GET request should be returning a status of ""301"" or ""302"", I have the GA SDK returning a ""200"". Switching back to the GA SDK fixes the problem. When we have tested using the following code, the status returned is ""302"" in and ""301"" in h4. Steps to reproduce a) Create a simple project. b) Update this code in c) Run this with testing environment h4.

Actual results if you enable the in the custom theme, the views will be smaller. h4. Extra info I attached a full testcase in the form of a project with the name. h4. Problem Description returns as a blob in physical memory!! If the file size is large, for example, over 1GB, it could cause low memory crash. Plus, using in this case takes too much time to run in the background. iOS only allows 30 seconds. Chances are the app will be either crashed or suspended before the file is saved. I suggest: upon move the file to a temp directory and return the path instead of a blob. h4. TESTING ENVIRONMENT CLI version Titanium SDK version iOS7 h4. CODE SAMPLE h3. h4. STEP TO REPRODUCE - Create a new Project - Double-click the Project's file to open it in the Overview tab. - In the Modules section, click the Add button (green plus sign) to open the Mobile Modules dialog. - Locate and select This module is part of the Titanium SDK since Release - Click OK. - Copy the code segment above to the project file - Run the Project h4.

The map never ask for permission for the GPS access, not even if the user presses the location icon google will briefly flash ""Location could not be identified"" h4. Extra information Use case: When we open a html5 page that as a geolocation titanium does not give access to GPS on the device.. Android: Images do not scale UP properly on Android (parity issue). h4. Problem Description The 320x180 image in the testcase should be scaled UP to fill the width of the window (left: 0, right: 0) with it's height automatically adjusted to maintain the image aspect ratio. This is exactly what happens on iOS. On android, the is contstrained to the original image height, and the image's aspect ratio is maintained, thus leaving a large unfilled area to the left and right of the image. Since the size is set to the expected behaviour would be that the image is scaled up to fit the full width of the ImageView and it's size adjusted upward to fit the contents of the scaled up image. Again, on iOS this expected behaviour is exactly what happens. But on Android, you get the unexpected result of an image with limited width. h4. Steps to reproduce 1. Create a new mobile project 2. Add Android to the supported platforms 3. Add this testcase to 4. If you run this in Android, you will see red next to the image. If you run this in iOS it will be nicely filling the space, no red in the screen..

Take a look at for .open(), but currently we can't use the bootstrapping to extend the API because we create different objects instead of using the prototype.. Some of the Titanium implementation can be done using JavaScript so we need to provide a way to run our own bootstrapping .js files before we load There is possibly a lot of JavaScript code we can reuse from the android directory. The method I suggest is to package the .js files into the .bar file. The files should be put into a new folder called ""framework"" that is next to, not inside, the ""assets"" folder. The ""assets"" and ""framework"" folders should be separate so we don't have conflicts. The only complication would be that the require() and include() functions might need a flag to know whether the app has been bootstrapped or not (ie read from ""framework"" if bootstrapping and ""assets"" if not). A flag may not be sufficient if things are done asynchronously so the other solution would be to check if the file calling the is in ""framework"" or ""assets"" and make sure to load the file from the same directory. There should be one file called that will the other files, as needed.. This could be added to the script. This is an example of what the script should do:. ",3,250,1389

Titanium Studio: MobileWeb: Packaging: allow packaging to non-existent directory. Steps to reproduce: 1.

Suggested fix: * When creating a new project as part of the mobile web packaging wizard, create a new default server for use in preview and associate it with that project.. Kevin, I believe your comment is meant for TISTUD-1269 instead.. The Mobile Web ""browser preview"" launch configuration uses some separate settings for determining which browser to launch. Instead, we should have a drop down respecting the current browser settings in preferences: If user selects to specifically choose a different option than the global settings, have a drop down with the following options: System browser Browser 2 * Have a link to open the preference page for users to manage the settings. If any launch configuration fails because a browser setting has been removed, fall back to an external browser using the system default.. Indicates the outline is out of date when there is syntax error in the code. This is related to TISTUD-1000. Currently the domain information is only needed during login, so it makes sense to add the domain field to the ""Already have an account radio"".

Studio: Installing new SDK from CLI causes Blackberry and Tizen to gray out. Package Alloy Geocoder sample in Studio. Currently for Alloy samples, we call ""alloy new"" to create the default app and then unzip the sample content on top of it, but for Geocoder sample in due to the complexity related to ALOY-891, we decide that it will contain the full-fledged app in a zip, and we will define the sample using our existing sample extension point..

After TISTUD-5666 is implemented, global toolbar will automatically launch it. We want to provide a toggle menu item where user could modify the behavior to not auto-launch on selection. The toggle should be available in the launch shortcut dropdown and in all modes, and it should apply globally to the workspace..

Configuration: iOS - ""iPad"" appears in the iOS simulator configuration when profiling or testing on iPhone simulator. Missing run menu item on Windows. Add to the global toolbar dropdown when package mode is selected. We should have a option in the global device profile dropdown for when package mode is selected as we had under Publish icon in the local toolbar of Project Explorer. There should be a separator between it and the shortcuts, and it will launch the run configuration dialog instead of select it as an entry.. Default Android emulator is launched when using older version of the TiSDK with Studio. Run on iOS Device: add list of devices to the launch config dialog. With the new capability of launching directly on iOS device provided by CLI, we will need to update the launch configuration dialog to include the list of devices to. In the output of ""ti info -o json"" for CLI it will contain a section ""ios"" ""devices"". We should display this list in place of ""iOS Device"", and when one is invoked, pass the id value in the flag to ""ti build"" command.. We should have a ""Run option in the global device profile dropdown as we had under Run icon in the local toolbar of Project Explorer. There should be a separator between it and the shortcuts, and it will launch the run configuration dialog instead of select it as an entry.. 1. Open Preferences Studio Themes; 2. Switch Overall Theme to ""Dark Studio"" and switch back to ""Light Studio"". The Project Explorer view will then become unreadable due to text. Have to restart Studio to get it display properly.. In the output of ""ti info -o json"" for CLI it contains a section ""android"" ""devices"", where it contains info such as id, name, model, and manufacturer. We should display this list in place of Android Device, and when one is invoked, pass the id value in the flag to ""ti build"" command.. Quitting Studio from the login screen hangs indefinitely. Investigate if loading tiapp's Build Properties section needs to be improved, and if so, move the time-consuming task to non-UI thread.. Profile TiApp editor for expensive operations that should be run on non-UI threads. We should run a profile session on opening TiApp editor and locate the bottleneck. Once located, we should move those operations to be run off the UI thread and have some indication to say the tiapp is loading.. It is unlikely user would use Studio to browse local filesystem, and Titanium development is very much project-based, so we should remove the node for Studio. We will still keep it for Aptana Studio.. The feeling is App Explorer doesn't add compelling value and feels redundant next to Project Explorer. We will hide deprecate it from default Studio perspectives but keep the plugin.. Studio freezes for a moment when loading Deploy Targets section of tiapp editor. We have each mode broken out as it's own pulldown menu. We should adopt the UI where there's a giant ""play"" Run button that is pulldown to toolbar of App Project Explorer.. 1. Delete Global Appcelerator NPM Packages. 2. Install Studio. 4. Run Studio and accept npm package updates. Result: The updates are locally installed to a folder other than the one studio was run from. See screenshot. Expected Result: The updates are globally installed. Note: If you try to run studio commands that require the npm packages, they will fail. Studio looks here no matter what (and the commands fail): Workaround:. UI blocked during install of Selected Platform SDK. Make npm packages required installs and not allow user to dismiss required installs. Mobile Web configuration: load browsers info in the background when platform config wizard is opened. Platform Config Wizard: Align the start of text in settings section with the platform entry. The screenshot shows the left bound of settings section matches with the checkbox. The suggestion is to match it with platform name instead. If that causes too much space on the left visually, then we will revert to implement based on this screenshot.. Platform Config Wizard: create a gradient effect from the platform section to its settings section. To improve the background transition from the main platform section to settings section, a suggestion is to add a gradient in the middle.. The gradient didn't look great when implemented in Eclipse, and the new icon on the left does help to indicate which platform the settings section belongs to, so marking this as invalid.. Make the Advanced Settings text and arrow right-aligned Move the arrow to the right of the text Modify the text to say ""Settings"" when collapsed and ""Hide"" when expanded Make the status center-aligned Remove warning icon for ""Not Yet Configured"". Formatter fails on javascript braces block. Currently the wrench icon appears on the left of platform checkbox, while info icon appears on the lower right. Since the two are mutually exclusive, only one could appear at any time, the suggestion is to line them up on the same side.. Since we are downloading and installing Android, BlackBerry, and Tizen SDKs directly from the platform config wizard, we need to display the respective EULAs for user to accept. This ticket is to implement the UI for accepting EULA. We will open a separate dialog for EULA when user clicks Finish to configure the list of selected platforms. The dialog will just contain a large multi-line text field where it contains the EULA text for each platform in sequential order. The dialog will have two buttons - Accept and Decline, and user doesn't need to scroll down to the bottom of the text to have Accept enabled. When accepted, we will move to the progress page; when declined, we will close the platform config wizard.. Platform Config Wizard: Display the EULAs for selected platforms in separate dialog. Currently the description just says ""Select platforms to configure"". It doesn't really add more information to the title in explaining what the wizard does. We should improve the message. A suggestion: ""Download, install, and configure required SDKs for the mobile platforms you would like to develop. Platform Config Wizard: modify the status when we finish configuring a platform. When we finished configuring a platform, we should update the status area to display two lines: the regular check mark and latest installed version on top, and the installation location below. The Settings text and arrow should remain hidden. If the installation is canceled, we should show ""Canceled"" status but without any icon.. Related to TISTUD-5326. For iOS, currently there is no Advanced Settings section, and the visual indicator will appear in its place, making the UI feel inconsistent. The suggestion is to line it up on the right as indicators for other platforms are.. Platform Config Wizard: iOS: move the visual indicator for downloading to the right-most column. Android: Emulator: Enable Fastdev for SDK. Loading iOS provisioning profiles: Improve the error message when CLI is not found. If the CLI is not installed or if it is installed to a location that is not in user's PATH, user will run into a NPE when the provision profiles are loaded. We should better handle such cases.. If user selects an unconfigured platform, disable ""Finish"" and enable ""Next"". Make next page be the install wizard page. Filter that page down to only the selected platform. When user finishes wizard we'll install the unconfigured platform first, then create project. If a platform fails to install we'll need to prompt if it's OK to create project with that platform and let them know how to install it later through tiapp editor?. We currently disable unconfigured platforms in the listing. We should enable them, and the severity of all about them not being configured should be reduced to Info icons.. The second point will no longer apply after TISTUD-5322 is implemented.. The preference page of Android does not react immediately to user actions. For instance, - Takes long time to open the preference page. - If Configure button is clicked, then it takes a long time to open the dialog that shows the list of Android SDKs. - It takes a long time to initialize the status based on the new SDK location.. The Configure button currently opens the dashboard. With the platform configuration wizard implemented, it should open the wizard instead, with only Android item checked by default.. Platform Config Wizard: Investigate the steps to setup Tizen on various OSes. We will host the necessary Tizen on our server (TISTUD-5245). However, we need to figure out if we can install silently into a specific location (preferred), if we have to run the installer for users and wait for the completion, and other potential unknowns.. Once user clicks ""Configure"" with Android respective URLs. The progress dialog should indicate the proper progress since we have the control on the process.. This is an extension of TISTUD-5246. When the wizard is opened, we should check if Tizen is already installed in the default location or if the preference page already has a valid SDK path set (meaning user has configured it either through the wizard or set the path directly in preferences). If so, we should display the installed version next to the platform checkbox instead of ""Not Configured"".. This is an extension of TISTUD-5243. When the wizard is opened, we should check if BlackBerry is already installed in the default location or if the preference page already has a valid SDK path set (meaning user has configured it either through the wizard or set the path directly in preferences). If so, we should display the installed version next to the platform checkbox instead of ""Not Configured"".. This is an extension of TISTUD-5242. When the wizard is opened, we should check if Android is already installed in the default location or if the preference page already has a valid SDK path set (meaning user has configured it either through the wizard or set the path directly in preferences). If so, we should display the latest installed version, Android next to the platform checkbox instead of ""Not Configured"".. After user selects the platforms and clicks ""Configure"", we should provide a progress dialog where we indicate the progress on individual platforms. User should be able to put it in the background or cancel the operation.. In the platform configuration wizard, there should be an entry for Tizen, and it should contain an expandable ""Advanced Settings"" section where user could set a path for the root Tizen SDK location. It will be filled initially by a default path, The text next to the checkbox should say ""Not Configured"" by default. This ticket just covers the UI aspect. There will be separate tickets for dealing with the actual configuration once ""Configure"" is clicked as well as auto-detecting if Tizen is already installed in the default location to update the UI state accordingly.. In the platform configuration wizard, there should be an entry for BlackBerry, and it should contain an expandable ""Advanced Settings"" section where user could set a path for the root BlackBerry NDK location. It will be filled initially by a default path, The text next to the platform checkbox should say ""Not Configured"" by default. This ticket just covers the UI aspect. There will be separate tickets for dealing with the actual configuration once ""Configure"" is clicked as well as auto-detecting if BlackBerry is already installed in the default location to update the UI state accordingly.. In the platform configuration wizard, there should be an entry for Android, and it should contain an expandable ""Advanced Settings"" section where user could customize the following: Set a path for the root Android SDK location. It will be filled initially by a default path, Choose what Android SDK versions to install. The list should contain from the minimum version (currently we support to the maximum version available. By default, the minimum version and the maximum available version are selected. The text next to the checkbox should say ""Not Configured"" by default. This ticket just covers the UI aspect. There will be separate tickets for dealing with the actual configuration once ""Configure"" is clicked as well as auto-detecting if Android SDK is installed in the default location to update the UI state accordingly.. In the platform configuration wizard, there should be an entry for iOS. It will have an Advanced Settings section to customize the Xcode location. By default, the location should be filled with and the text next to the checkbox should say ""Not Configured"". This ticket just covers the UI aspect. There will be separate tickets for dealing with the actual configuration once ""Configure"" is clicked as well as auto-detecting if Xcode is already installed in the default location to update the UI state accordingly.. Field Service: In description of Field Service Sample in Dashboard we should state to read the ReadMe to configure. Allow create Alloy Application Templates using Rubles. h5. Problem description After hard restarting the system (for everything was completely frozen), Appcelerator Studio was not starting anymore. After launching it and choosing an existing workspace, the login screen didn't appear - only the red Studio Splashscreen was being displayed. Here is the console details: h5. Workaround After deleting the folder, Studio would start correctly.. Appcelerator Studio: stuck on the splash screen when restart. Run Configurations dialog: create new iOS Application Installer config failed with exception. Add Alloy navigation shortcuts to the Project Explorer. Support optional comma in tss file. LiveView: Remove the launch configuration contribution. Remove the contribution to applicable launch configurations for enabling LiveView as we will be using the global toggle to control the setting. For existing launch configs, we should ignore the liveview attribute and also use the global setting.. Add a toggle button in App Project Explorer toolbar to enable disable LiveView for the next run. This will be a global state to control if the next applicable launch (run on iOS Android and at the moment) will be run with LiveView on or off. Initially the button is toggled off, and the workflow is as followed: 1. User toggles the button on and do Run iOS Simulator, the simulator will be run with liveview; 2. User toggles it off, do Run Android Emulator, the emulator will be run without liveview; 3. To run the iOS simulator without liveview, user will just do Run iOS Simulator again since now the setting is off.. When a tss file in Alloy project is Alloy project.. When a js file in Alloy project is Alloy project.. When a xml file in Alloy project is Alloy project.. Studio: the Plugin zip does not exist on the update site. No menu items appear under when an invalid Android SDK path is set in preferences. 1. Open Run Run dialog; 2. Double click on Appcelerator iOS iTunes Distribution. Expected behavior: the launch configuration is created right away and its UI appears. Actual behavior: it takes a few seconds or longer, depending on how many certificates and provisioning profiles you have, for the launch config UI to appear, and the UI is frozen in the mean time. The same behavior applies to iOS Distribution and iOS Application Installer. We should improve the behavior by doing something similar to what we did in iOS preference page, showing in the related combo-box and load the certificates in the background. The Run button should also be disabled until the combo-box is filled with actual values.. It's nice that we are now providing additional info on why a platform is disabled in new mobile project wizard. However, the position of the error mark is misleading. For example, in the screenshot attached, it's easy to think Android and Mobile Web are having configuration errors, not BlackBerry and Tizen. The error mark probably should be after the platform name, and hovering over the disabled text should also show the reason.. NPE in the log when getting the latest SDK release while Studio is shutting down. Can't terminate iOS Simulator process from the console. iOS Packaging Run Config: 'Upload debug symbol' checkbox deactivates 'Run' option. This does not occur Test Steps: 1. Package iOS App (Ad-Hoc or iTunes). 2. Goto Configuration New Configuration and select the 'Upload debug symbol option' Actual Result: 1. 'Run' option is active before selecting the 'Uploading debug symbols' checkbox. 2. 'Run' option is disabled after selecting the 'Uploading debug symbols' checkbox. Please refer the attached screen shot for further clarification.. BlackBerry: Allow BB project creation with spaces in the app name. should not allow create a method with space in the name. Could be fixed after TISTUD-4744 is resolved.. When manually terminating a debug session by clicking on the debug-stack threads (the ones that say ""Remote node and ""JavaScript Thread""), the launch state is not terminated. This forces the user to manually click the launch, and hit terminate again, before allowing the launch to be removed from the view. We need to terminate the launch when terminating the thread.. BlackBerry: cannot run the created package or device launch configuration from configurations dialog. 1. Create a BlackBerry project; 2. Run Publish Distribute - BlackBerry; 3. Open Publish dialog; 4. Select the created Titanium BlackBerry Packager launch configuration if it isn't selected. Expected result: ""Run"" button should be enabled to run the launch config without any change since there is no error. Actual result: ""Run"" button is disabled. The same behavior is observed on device launch configuration as well.. Binding: disable OK button in import binding dialog if nothing selected. disable OK button and add a message on the reason when the input matches the current cname. Added an image of Xamarin installer and a screenshot from OSX Installer wiki page for a couple of examples of installer on Mac. The bullet points for us would include something similar: license, prerequisites destination, installation, and summary.. Embed Git check and install into Studio Windows installer. We currently include portablegit and prompt user to install at Studio start if no git is detected. Portablegit is for not just git support, but we also use it as our shell environment for Windows (terminal, getting shell env, etc). For the new installer, we should embed the git check and installation of portablegit in it.. Modify Studio Dashboard to invoke the new platform config wizard for configuring platforms. We currently have links in each platform section under Get Started tab to direct user to individual site for downloading the natvie SDKs. We should modify them to invoke the new platform config wizard with the specific platform selected.. Liveview: Fastdev prevents liveview from working on android emulator. This involves moving the launch shortcut and related classes for contributing the Run Android Device action to Android's own plugins.. This involves moving the launch shortcut and related classes for contributing the Run BlackBerry Device action to BlackBerry's own plugins.. Samples: double-click should expand folder node in Samples view. Summary log from chat recorded on poker session Story Time Chris Williams: I'm secretly in UK Thomas Huelbert: lol. Only prompt user for overwrite when installing a Titanium SDK that already exists. Dashboard: Mobile Web Configuration is not getting configured. Dashoard - Marketplace: clicking on the link doesn't open the page. Include PHP related rubles in the PHP feature. Include Ruby related rubles in the Ruby feature. The following rubles should be packaged in the Ruby feature instead of the Studio core feature: Capistrano, Cucumber, EngineYard, HAML, Heroku, Rails, Rspec, Ruby, Sass. We have an extension point to define a path where bundles are contained. Check plugin and for an example.. Move all references of BlackBerry from the mobile and core plugins to BlackBerry plugins. Once all the subtasks of refactoring the BlackBerry code into its own plugin is completed, all the references of BlackBerry from the mobile and plugins has to be either removed or moved to BlackBerry's ui core plugins. All the constants, resources and utility methods corresponding to BlackBerry should only be available in BlackBerry plugins.. Move Publish Distribute BlackBerry action to BlackBerry plugin. This involves moving the definitions and related classes for contributing the Publish Distribute BlackBerry action to BlackBerry's own plugins.. Refactor the modules table section of to have BlackBerry plugin contribute its column. The plugin will need to contribute the icon. We also need a mechanism to parse out the module version for BlackBerry to be shown in the table. Is the platform type enough, and the tiapp model could parse the directory structure from there?. Have BlackBerry plugin contribute to the preferences page. We should have a subnode for each platform under Preferences Studio Platforms and move the respective section from Platforms preference page there. The plugin will contribute the BlackBerry preference page and handle its preference settings.. Move Run BlackBerry Simulator action to BlackBerry plugin(s). This involves moving the launch shortcut and related classes for contributing the Run BlackBerry Simulator action to BlackBerry's own plugins.. Refactor the Deployment Targets section of to have BlackBerry plugin contribute its entry. We should be able to re-use the attributes defined from TISTUD-3053 for the ""Deployment Targets"" section of as the idea here is to also have BlackBerry plugin contribute the name, platform type, and if it's supported on the current system.. Refactor the mobile project wizard to have BlackBerry plugin contribute its entry. Currently the mobile project wizard defines all the checkboxes for deployment targets. We should have the BlackBerry plugins contribute the following attributes through the extension point from TISTUD-3066: 1. A display name 2. A string for platform type (""blackberry"") that will be used by CLI and other necessary operations; 3. A mean to check if the requirement for platform support is met, if the Titanium SDK contains the platform, if the platform SDK is installed (not applicable to Mobile Web), and if the OS supports the platform (not applicable here either), so the project wizard could enable disable the checkbox as appropriate. It should return a status so we could display a warning or error message if needed. 4. Potentially a post-project creation hook to perform any BlackBerry specific task needed (don't think we have any?). 5.

Refactor the mobile module project wizard to have Android plugin contribute its entry. Refactor the Titanium module project wizard to have Android plugin contribute its entry.. Move all references of Android from the mobile and core plugins to Android plugins. Once all the subtasks of refactoring the mobileweb code into its own plugin is completed, all the references of Android from the mobile and plugins has to be either removed or moved to Android's ui core plugins. All the constants, resources and utility methods corresponding to Android should only be available in Android plugins.. Move Publish Distribute Android App Store action to Android plugin. This involves moving the definitions and related classes for contributing the Publish Distribute Android App Store action to Android's own plugins.. Refactor the modules table section of to have Android plugin contribute its column. The plugin will need to contribute the icon. We also need a mechanism to parse out the module version for Android to be shown in the table. Is the platform type enough, and the tiapp model could parse the directory structure from there?. Have Android plugin contribute to the preferences page. We should have a subnode for each platform under Preferences Studio Platforms and move the respective section from Platforms preference page there. The plugin will contribute the Android preference page and handle its preference settings.. Move Run Android Emulator action to Android plugin(s). This involves moving the launch shortcut and related classes for contributing the Run Android Emulator action to Android's own plugins.. Refactor the Deployment Targets section of to have Android plugin contribute its entry.

Russ provided the command in TISTUD-4134: ti build blackberry -T distribute ""pookiepie"". Improve beta rc update process. Currently when we release a Beta or RC candidate, besides updating to the right version of Studio, user will also need to update their npm packages from command line. See for an example on the number of steps users need to do. The idea is to improve the process by utilizing the update stream user set in Studio preferences page and installing the beta rc versions of npm packages when checking for updates. The published versions for npm packages will include ""-beta"" and ""-cr"".. Surface Full Error: CLI: project create: Invalid platform: blackberry. File New From Template: Remove Alloy entry. The current Alloy Blank File doesn't really make sense. If we keep the Alloy menu, the options should be for creating Since it only makes sense from a project context, and we have the corresponding menus there, We should remove it from File New From Template.. File New From Template: not to show Blank File option if it has no siblings. Change ""All"" category to ""Others"" in mobile project wizard. The ""All"" category is intended to contain the project templates that don't have a category defined in addition to the ones with categories. The suggestion is to modify it to ""Others"" where it only contains the list of project templates without a category.. The order should be Run, Debug, Profile, Test. The Profile and Test contributions should occur after the ""Inspect"" and ""Watch"" groups.. Improve the error message when login failed. Titanium Project: new project that includes blackberry target uses legacy python script. If a new Titanium Project is created, and BlackBerry is included as a selected deployment target, the old python creation script will be called instead of the standard CLI script. Project Creation Script Overview: Test Steps: 1. Verify BlackBerry is Installed. 2. Create Titanium Project (all deployment targets, including blackberry). Current Behavior: Python script is called. Expected Result: CLI script is called.. h5. Improvement description Alloy projects .xml files should also present the hover info like for .js files. When passing the mouse over an .xml element, information should be displayed as a popup like for objects in the .js files.. Alloy: add hover info for element names in Alloy .xml file. When we have the following code in a tss file: and hit Enter, it becomes The expected result is to auto-indent to. This task is for writing the , , and builtins for the CLI for Denso platform (IVI) only, as per the . Please see for reference.. The Denso platform, called IVI, will be Mobile Web based. This ticket is to support the additional ""ivi"" option for the flag in ""titanium create call to create a Titanium project. For IVI, we could just follow the instruction in specifically the following part, as there are no additional setup steps needed on the IVI side for the moment: ""Create a folder in the Titanium SDK distribution and then update the array of platforms in the SDK's to include the. Steps to reproduce: 1. Create a project with Tizen platform enabled; 2. In Project Explorer, run Run Tizen on Device. The text in the console should say ""Launching Tizen app on device"".. Linux: Run New Configuration Window Build tab contents are not visible properly. Creating ticket fails in Titanium Studio with special character in the password. Package JDK in the Windows installer. We currently package a specific version of JRE when installed Studio on Windows. The suggestion is to package an equivalent version of JDK instead. We should also add the JDK path to the system path variable.. The preference page node will be under Platforms, and the content will contain a field for the Denso SDK location and a browse button. It should validate the path and generate from it. The IVI SDK is at. The IVI SDK is built as a Titanium module, so we could download and update it directly at startup, and no preferences page is needed. Resolving as invalid.. Steps to Reproduce: 1. Clean install Titanium Studio 2. Check for Titanium updates. 3. Select Titanium Code Processor. Actual Result: The documentation is minimal. Expected Result: We should have change logs similar to what we have with CLI.. The builds are in place; we just need to update the sync-nightly job (and sync-beta and sync-rc) to publish the respective Jenkins build to a public update site. The url will be in the form of. Suggest to have a group of radio buttons or a combo-box in preferences page with options Stable, RC, Beta, and Nightly. Stable will be the default choice, and when user switches to another selection, RC, we will scan the list of available update sites and replace the ones containing stable with urls containing rc. So for the base Studio, with be disabled and will be added and enabled. This will apply to the add-on plugins that we provide as well, and we will keep the update url naming convention consistent across all the features. It will help reduce the likelihood of having incompatible versions of plugins installed against each other. We could also have a remote file that contains the list of our update url prefixes, and we will append the right update stream type for the full URL to add and remove. This avoids the issue of user modifying the list of update sites manually and we no longer able to find the original url to replace.. Update the Dashboard side to call the SDK-Info command with a ""tizen"" key. Then, parse the result and display any info (like we do with the rest of the platforms). The Tizen section in Dashboard will look similar to what BlackBerry one shows.. Updating the Studio code to support Tizen when checking for the supported platforms. This includes the work to update the file with link to the Tizen SDK download (. Haven't been able to reproduce locally, but we have seen a number of reports from users that alloy templates do not show up in Titanium project wizard. When we checked the log, the ""alloy info templates"" command doesn't appear to get called. We need to check under what condition it could occur. Attached a user log. Also we had user try running ""alloy info templates"" directly from the command line, and it returns the expected json output.. When re-publishing an Oracle module integrated app, the developer should be alerted that an overwrite of a previously published application is going to occur. Reference the doc at. The publishing should happen through Oracle APIs(check the Resource Manager APIs). See Use the Resource Manager APIs to create the publication, package it with an application, and publish it to the mobile server. See the in the Oracle Database Mobile Server JavaDoc, which is located off the page. Reference the doc at. Reference for using the publish provider extension. 1. The supported platform is Android; 2. The publish target is the Oracle Mobile Server. We have a test server as specified in. Reference for contributing to the Publish menu.

This is a regression. It did not happen in Studio Test Steps: New Project. project name. Finish. the creation of the project folder, cancel it by clicking on the red square at the bottom. Observe the error. Screenshots and logs attached.. Not to use legacy scripts if CLI is not installed and SDK is. Ignore the SDK version that starts with a non-numeric character. Studio currently doesn't handle a version string that doesn't start with a number instead of and CLI doesn't handle such SDK either, so we should just ignore it in our SDKLocator class.. Improve Module Packaging Run Config wording. See screenshot. Suggest using: ""A mobile app"" ""Mobile Project"" ""A directory"" ""Location"" (seems consistent with other run config menus) Applies to all module packagers (Android, iOS, Steps to Reproduce: 1. Create Titanium Module. 2. Package Titanium Module and view run config menu. Actual Result: Odd strings. Expected Result: Consistent and meaningful UI.. Add Blackberry Applications Installer to the run configurations. Currently the Eclipse node debugger plugins contribute their own JS editor that opens the generated files. We should remove it and make our existing JS editor the default one so it doesn't cause confusion. It will also make theming consistent.. Checkout the source code (using ""svn checkout and fix the syntax for the following plugins so it compiles against JRE. Include Eclipse node debugger plugins and make them JRE compatible. Steps to Reproduce: 1. Create Alloy Project. 2. Project Context Click New Alloy Model. 3. Enter name, press OK. Actual Result: Strange error. Expected Result: The OK button should be disabled when no column entries are entered yet.. Investigate adding support for BlackBerry development on Linux.

In the Project Explorer pane, right-click New logo is not centered properly and doesn't fit with other icons we have. logo should be improved.. Add formatting support to TSS files after parser is created. We could copy from JSON formatter and extend. Here is an example of formatted TSS file:. The action will invoke a wizard that contains the same fields the packaging launch configuration tab has (TISTUD-3262) except for the project field.. The action will create launch shortcut based on the launch configuration defined in TISTUD-3258 and install the Tizen app on device. The menu should only appear when the Tizen platform is enabled in project's. The action will create the launch shortcut for the corresponding launch config from TISTUD-3257 and directly install the app on Tizen emulator without an additional wizard. The menu should only appear when the Tizen platform is enabled in project's. Add support for the packaging command via the CLI extension. See for the doc on downloading and running Tizen-enabled CLI.. We should try call ""build"" again when we've cleaned all our projects and build automatically is checked. The platform does not support incremental builds, so that call should probably only happen when a 'clean-build' is performed. See for the doc on installing a version of CLI that supports Tizen.. See for the doc on downloading and running Tizen-enabled CLI.. The preference page node will be under Titanium, and the content will contain a field for the Tizen SDK location and a browse button. It should validate the path and generate from it. The Tizen SDK could be downloaded at. The checkbox should only be enabled when user specified the Tizen SDK location in the preferences page and the selected Titanium SDK has Tizen platform support.. We should show Tizen as a checkbox in the deployment targets section of Titanium project creation wizard. The checkbox should only be enabled if user specified the Tizen SDK location in the preferences page and the selected Titanium SDK version has Tizen support. Please see for the doc on the Tizen-enabled CLI.. The action will create launch shortcut based on the launch configuration defined in TISTUD-3118 and install the app on IVI device.

The action will invoke a wizard that contains the same fields the packaging launch configuration tab has (TISTUD-3119) except for the project field.. Add support for the packaging command via the CLI extension.. We should try call ""build"" again when we've cleaned all our projects and build automatically is checked. The platform does not support incremental builds, so that call should probably only happen when a 'clean-build' is performed.. ""Screenshots"" Field should be renamed as ""Attachments"" in ""Submit a Ticket"" screen in studio. Steps to Reproduce 1. Choose Help Titanium Studio Submit Ticket. 2. Attach css, html, etc any type of file Actual Result All attachments of any type gets attached. Expected Result One is able to attach only jpeg or png type files for ""Screenshots"" field. Or The field should be renamed as Attachment to provide more options to the users.. Titanium Updates doesn't show on a clean machine. After project templates for Denso are defined and created, we will need to include them in the Denso version of Titanium Studio.. Move all references of mobile web from the mobile and core plugins to mobileweb plugin. In alloy the following format will generate the model appropriately for all supported adapters types: (sql, properties, and localStorage): so for example, a sql model would be generated like this: However, we currently call ""alloy generate model myModel Need to add ""sql"" after the model name. For the other adapter types, we are inserting the type correctly, so just need to fix for sql.. Dashboard: Update Android SDK to on staging.. Add launch configuration for packaging Denso application. The launch configuration tab for now could contain just a project field and the distribution location. We will add more if more fields are required.

Once we've updated TISTUD-2001, we just need to alter the installer to actually include the check. See the parent ticket for the URL from which to download the installer.. Pass in JAVA HOME to Python scripts. While testing ""Build Acceptance Android Only"", I attempted to build a default Titanium Mobile app (just the standard template) and I encounter the following problem: I check and the $JAVA HOME is set, but was not available to the Python script. Studio should check for the JAVA HOME before beginning a build, check if it is correctly set, and if it is missing or incorrect pass in a correct version into the build. This issue is a not a regression since the bug is due to a user of JAVA HOME. Steps used to reproduce: 1. Ensure that the $JAVA HOME global variable is set ( ls -R $JAVA HOME ). 2. Create a new Titanium Mobile Project. 3. Create a signing key. 4. Package for Distribution (Package Distribute - Android App Store) Expected result: Android correctly packages and a package file is created in the specified place. Actual result: The packager gets to where it can not find java as $JAVA HOME isn't available to it. Tested by multiple sources on Titanium Studio build and on both Ubuntu and using SDK replicated the same failure. Switching back to SDK fixes the issue in all studio platforms, as is the first version to use JAVA HOME in the packaging scripts. Suggested solution: If it is, check if the JAVA HOME variable is correct by checking for at that path * If it is incorrectly set, or not set, infer the JAVA HOME location by using values from Studio's environment.. Titanium Studio: SDK Updates: canceling extraction does not produce a warning. During an SDK update, if the extraction process is canceled, there is no longer an error message generated. This is a regression. This worked in It is worth noting (not part of the regression) that the partially extracted SDK remains in the SDK folder, resulting in an invalid SDK. When the SDK is in this invalid state: It is still selectable by titanium projects, and if it is a stable release, it will not be recognized as needing an update. Steps to Reproduce: 1. Download any version of the SDK using a method such as: Help Check for Titanium SDK Updates or Help Install Specific Titanium 2. During the extraction process (which occurs after the process), press 'Cancel'. Actual Result: No error dialog, no error logs. Expected Result: Error dialog pop-up and error logs, with a button allowing the user to open an window to the extracted location on disk (if they wish to remove it themselves). Change AppID validation to only allow upper and lower letters (A-Z, a-z), digits (0-9), and period. Steps to reproduce: 1. Create default TiMobile app 2. During creation of default app, include an underscore in the application id name 3. Install app to device Actual: In the console, will get error. See attachment. Expected: Replace underscores with dashes in the app ID. Note: You can install to Android device without any issues A similar issue happens if you have a '-' in the app id. In order to have the widest cross-platform appIDs, we can only allow upper and lower letters (A-Z, a-z), digits (0-9), and periods. Once a user has installed, we need to install the nettle package for deployment: If not, install it. Suggestion is that we don't really know if we need to sun under sudo. We should try without, and then prompt the user if we fail in that case.. Rebrand functionality as Appcelerator Custom Cloud Services. Summary log from chat recorded on poker session Story Time 20120710: Chris Williams: I will not be silenced. Enable packaging of Alloy applications. This may not require any additional work. We may simply need to run the existing script as we do with typical Titanium projects. See here for confirmation:. Enable running of Alloy applications. This may not require any additional work. We may simply need to run the existing script as we do with typical Titanium projects. See here for confirmation:. Add blank Alloy project template to project wizard. By default, a new Titanium project is an Alloy project. Select the ""blank new alloy template"" as the default in the titanium mobile project wizard. This creates an alloy project without any template.. Install Alloy package using NPM. Include offline API and Help documentation. h4. Problem Description If you don't have a working internet connection, you won't be able to browse the Ti Mobile SDK Docs from the help menu in the Ti Studio. Would be nice if we include the doc in SDK's Zipfile, so you can get the exact doc according to which SDK you are using. This will make easier to work with Titanium when in a flight or similar places. This should be a separate feature added to the update site.. Add check for pre-existing files to Titanium Mobile Project creation wizards. Signup link in Ti Studio login dialog does not work if browser preferences are changed. Check to make sure is installed For linux, install for Ubuntu, otherwise ask user to install themselves. If it is, confirm it's within the currently supposed version range. If not, inform the user to upgrade or install a new version If it's not installed, download the current package from an appcelerator web site (so we can ship a stable version). Each platform for Titanium Mobile has extra content placed into a tab. approximately something like: Add a mechanism whereby each platform can contribute a tab (similar to that shown in the screenshot, and via an extension point) that contains additional configuration information. As an initial pass, suggest just showing the text content of the for that platform in a text box so it can be edited. In the future, we could amend this to show additional UI. The ""All Platforms"" in the screenshot is not applicable.. Add per-platform mobile configuration tab for editor. When creating a module in studio, the creation fails with internal error: could not move file. Screenshot and log attached. This only occurs with android modules. However, android modules can be created from the command line. Steps to Reproduce: 1. Go to New Titanium Mobile Module Project. 2. Type in a project name and module id. 3. Deselect Use Default Location. 4. Browse to a new location Desktop ti). 5. Create the module. Actual Result: Error. Expected Result: New Module.. Titanium Studio: Upgrade Install Titanium Module to Project to include module in. If a module is installed to project using Help Install Titanium Module, the module is not added to the If a module is packaged to project, it is included in the There is no log info. Steps to Reproduce: 1. Create a new Titanium Mobile project. 2. Create a new Titanium Module project. 3. Package the module to a directory Downloads). 4. Go to Help Install Titanium Module. 5. In Install from URL, select the packaged module zip. 6. In Output, select Project, and select the app project you created. Press OK. Actual Result: Module gets unzipped to project, but the module is not in the Expected Result: Module should unzip to project, and a module xml tag should be added to The module should be visible in the TiApp Overview.. Titanium Studio: If Titanium SDK root folder is read-only, Studio will not prompt the user with an error. If the root Titanium SDK folder is readonly and latest sdk is not there, Studio will not find an sdk to update when update sdk is called. Step to reproduce: 1. 2. Delete the latest version of SDK folder 3. Give ""Titanium"" folder ""read only"" permission 4. Open 5. bar 6. Select ""Check for Titanium SDK updates"" Actual result: displaying MSG. ""No update available"" Expected result: Documentation web page should load in a browser.. Download the latest beta release from Run Studio. After logging in, it will crash with the following log:. Titanium Studio: Menu bar: Submit a the tab key only jumps between text fields, not all fields. Rename ""Titanium Mobile Project"" to ""Titanium Project"" and ""Titanium Module Project"". In keeping with the removal of Desktop functionality from the core of Studio, we should rename ""Titanium Mobile Project"" to ""Titanium Project"" and ""Titanium Mobile Module Project"" to ""Titanium Module Project"". When trying to setup Android inside Titanium Studio, the wizard fails showing a window with the following error message: ""NLS missing message: in: OK"" I managed to install the SDK manually, but I get the same error message when I click the UPDATE button. This is a regression from This does not occur in. Android SDK wizard fails with the message ""NLS missing message: in:. Last line in JS editor does not have line number when word wrap is enabled. Create interface to manage existing Titanium SDKs. The enablement of the platform targets is inconsistent Steps: 1. Create a mobile project with just mobile web and SDK 2.

Description: While attempting to set a browser before running a mobile web preview, I noticed that the list of browsers did not include any specific browsers except firefox. It would be ideal to populate the list of installed browsers rather than have the user populate the list manually. Steps to reproduce: 1) Install Studio 2) Create project with mobile web target 3) Run in browser 4) Select ""run and use the browser selection section Result: Firefox is the only 3rd-party browser listed although I have Chrome, Firefox, and Safari Expected: Firefox not displayed, or all installed browsers displayed Note: The version of the browser is displayed here as part of the name of the browser.. Add ""continuous integration master"" stream to ""Install Specific Titanium. Improve accuracy of Testflight publish progress indicator. Studio: Local variables do not appear in content assist. h2. Description Developers need to be able to leverage the Android x86 emulator that was made available with Android SDK r17. It claims to have performance increases beyond the standard emulator making for a better development experience. h2. Proposed Solution(s) It would be good if you could specify by default whether you want to use the x86 or standard emulator for all projects, perhaps in . It should be the standard emulator by default as the x86 emulator currently does not include the Google APIs (which would prevent the KitchenSink from running) and it does not support V8, as detailed in the linked ticket. Also, it should be configurable on a per-project basis as well, for the same reasons I listed in the above paragraph. So: We need to upgrade our AVI detection to show the available ABIs per device For devices with multiple ABIs we need to allow the user to select which one to use as part of the launch configuration, and that is passed as the first argument to the SDK for SDKs For < we only pass the device argument We could add a preference in Titanium Preferences to default to x86 or standard emulator (were available). This would se the default ABI selection in the launch configuration.. Titanium Studio: Multiline Search: add ""Select All"" command to select all to search and replace boxes. When clicking on text in the search or replace boxes, it is difficult to select all the text. Steps to Reproduce: 1. Open studio, create a new project, open the file. 2. Open search bar (command + f on osx). 3. Copy paste a larger block of code in the search box. 4. Attempt to use the ""Select All"" command to select all the text Expected Result: All text in the box highlights. Actual Result: Select all doesn't work.. h4. Problem Description I published an App to the App Store and Google Play but the app never appeared on ""My Apps"". The original guid was: Because I noticed new projects showed up on ""My Apps"" I've created a new project and transplanted the guid to the of my app. Released it to the Play Store and this enabled the app to show on ""My Apps"" where it says ""122 analytics events were processed for this application since May 1, 2012"" but it still shows 0 users, 0 sessions and ""There were no events logged during between 5 7 and The new guid is: I wrote more about this in but haven't received any feedback. Can you take a look?. Currently, the default studio workspace is Titanium Studio Workspace. Because the workspace contains spaces, Android modules cannot be packaged. One suggestion is to change the default workspace to one without spaces to facilitate module development. As per discussion, it was suggested to use:. Android modules created from command line cannot be packaged in studio. There is no package option in the UI. Note: Android modules created in studio, and iPhone modules created from the command line, work as expected. Steps to Reproduce: 1. Create an android module from the command line. 2. Import the module into studio. 3. Attempt to package the module box icon Package Android Module). Expected Result: Package option should be available. Actual Result: Package option is not available. h3. Suggested solution When importing an existing Titanium project, check for the existence of a file, and set the appropriately.. With support for JavaScript (commonJS and MobileWeb) modules being added, we now need the ability to display and select javascript modules in the TiStudio Modules panel. Show the modules In the popup to select per-platform versions, for commonjs modules, only show a single drop down for selecting a version which will apply across all platforms.. Add ability to log out of Jira account for ""Submit a ticket"". This assumes a project you have not yet created a local repo for Right click on a project Team Create on Name of repo Description of repo Organization you wish to publish to Public Private radio button See for information on publishing a new repo We should be proactive about seeing if we can test if a user has rights to create a repo within an organization, and if they have rights to make a repo private so we can alert them before the creation process.. Right click on a project Team Share GitHub Name of repo Description of repo Public Private radio button See for information on publishing a new repo If we allow a user to clone from organizations, we should also allow them to push to organizations. In that case, there is a slightly modified flow where we would need them to pick an organization first, and then we make a different call if pushing to an org.. I would like to be able to log in to my Github account and save my account information, possibly in our new ""Accounts"" preference page. Store: Password Additional buttons links: Sign up (to sign up for Github, which directs to the website). Add a UI to manage Keystore certificates. Similar to other platforms, support the creation of BlackBerry modules. We don't yet know exactly the steps involved.. The new Blackberry simulator utilizes a VMWare appliance. We'll need to launch against that. Improvements: Add IP address override to launch configuration (see TISTUD-1597 for root IP specification) Add password override to launch configuration (see TISTUD-1597 as well) Steps to use the integration: Launch VMWare Device Find out IP of device. User enters this in the main preference page, or in the launch configuration Run launch script, passing in IP address, password as arguments: required optional, for devices. Add a dashboard controller when given the URL to a module .zip file, installs the module to the SDK location on disk. If for a specific project, update the file (equivalent to what we do now when packaging a module for local distribution). Fail Titanium Studio build if plugin is missing rubles. In TiStudio open the file of an app with the GA, and click 'Enable'. An app is created in the cloud services. Click it again and another app is Suggested fix: Check to see if the file is dirty. If yes, alert the user that enabling cloud services will save the file. They can then choose to proceed, or click cancel. Enable cloud services. Save the file.. Using the dashboard search bar or the top ad link (""Reach Million Appcelerator Developers"") launches in a generic browser with no controls, providing difficult navigation. To address this, we'll need to switch the code that launches the browser in this case to be the same as the other cases on the dashboard (all other links open an external browser, and that appears to work correctly). it's a matter of triggering a portal action instead of using target "" new"" as part of the href.. Fail Jenkins build if Studio contains JDT plugins. Trailing semicolon after curly brace in conditional causes error in JS formatting. Steps to reproduce: 1. Create a new .js file in a project 2. Copy the following code and paste it into the .js file 3. Press on mac to format the pasted code Actual result: The following error is generated in the log file: !ENTRY 4 0 !MESSAGE (Build Error while formatting the code in your editor. Please submit a bug report through Studio's support and include the relevant code which triggered this error. Expected result: The code is formatted correctly. It appears to be that last trailing semicolon. Delete that, and it works.. If the current set of release notes is from a full HTML page that does not contain a , the release noes will launch in a new browser window. Allow for override of as a command-line option to make testing this easier. First try to grab apidiv. Then try to grab interior of body node, or if no body node, then whole content. If either work then replace release notes template with new content. If all else fails, use whole content and don't use the template. Notes: Anchor links didn't appear to work (might need to be munged?). After first loading Titanium Studio the template HTML Expected results: Should see a list of all available templates for HTML files. Actual results: Only a strange entry and the HTML 5 template appear.. When creating an application in ACS, we need to pass the GUID along with the call. The format will be: ti guid , passed to the call.. Use built-in ANT when packaging Android modules. Created a new Android mobile module project Attempt to package the project Run into this error: snippet of code: final Process osProcess It appears it can't find ANT. We package ANT as part of Studio, so we should instead use the built-in ANT rather than calling it on the command line. Workaround: Right-click on Click (the first option). When using the Android NDK, if you have spaces in your path Studio Workspace), Studio will fail to be able to build an Android module project. Suggest putting up a warning when creating a mobile module project warning users about the issue and informing them how to solve it (direct them to the wiki page on how to move switch their workspace:. Replace with accordion. Initially open a section to configure TISTUD-1456 perspective ** See APSTUD-4798 and APSTUD-4799 for actions to call The bottom half of the accordion is similar to what we have currently If we reduce or remove the top toolbar, we may wish to surface some common initial configuration options to the first tab of the equivalent to an initial questionnaire. It could be perhaps in some normally ""hidden"" area for ""advanced configuration"" if we determine it's useful but is confusing on first run.. An exercise in simplifying the new user experience: Create new ""Studio"" perspective add keyboard shortcuts commands for ""occurrences"", ""block selection"", ""show whitespace characters"" remove outline view remove servers, problems, terminal, console view ** keep console view hidden unless an error comes up. Studio: Build Participation: Windows does not update content assist for new class methods in Javascript. Packaging of Android module fails to copy built module to destination. When creating a mobile module project, we should be more strict about the name validation and the module-id validation. module-id should follow the Java conventions for package names (just like we do with Android).. When packaging to a non-existent directory, an error is presented and the user cannot package. Steps to Reproduce: 1. Create a new project. 2. Package for mobile web. 3. Create a path using a new sub-directory hand-typed. Expected Result: Should be able to package app and new directory is created. Actual Result: Warning prevents app from packaging. Suggested solution: Don't show warning * Pop up error if issue creating dir. Remove option to launch Mobile Web Preview in internal browser. The studio internal browser may not fire touch events to mobile web apps. Steps to Reproduce: 1. Create default app. 2. Preview in internal browser. 3. Click on buttons. Expected Result: The app should respond to click events. Actual Result: No response. Works on the other external browsers. It apparently sometimes works on some machines and not on others. Based on feedback, it appears there is some conflict between Mobile Web and the internal browser. Thus, the best option is to remove the ability to use the internal browser.. We'd like to make it easier for users to extend and contribute to the Titanium Desktop (TIDe) project. Refactor the current Titanium Desktop plugin(s) into a new repo We can remove references in the plugin, since the update process will likely be much different in the future Do we need to create the concept of a Titanium type desktop, mobile, ?) that would contribute a few things into the system Add a feature enabling users to install the plugin separately on top of Studio Create a hudson build to build this plugin and push it to a deployment site Change the license of the plugin to Apache 2 See attached image for dependencies.. Create a new Android Mobile Module project It should create the project, but have the warning ""Unbound classpath container: 'Default System Library' in project 'testAndroid'"" Attempting to fix that, it seems you should edit your Installed JREs preference page. However, the Standalone version of Studio doesn't have it, unlike the version of Eclipse (see screenshots). Attempting to install the JDT tools via the notes on this page (though substituting Indigo as a version) does not appear to work as you get conflicting dependency errors. It seems we either need to remove the JDT items, or we're not fully shipping the full set. Suggested fixes: Remove the django templates from Pydev, and allow users to install them optionally.. Auto-configure browser list to contain all installed browsers. Description: While attempting to set a browser before running a mobile web preview, I noticed that the list of browsers did not include any specific browsers except firefox. It would be ideal to populate the list of installed browsers rather than have the user populate the list manually.

Add ability to read packaged rubles from the Titanium SDK directory. Add platform attribute to module element(s). Clicking ""Publish"" multiple times when package application for distribution on Mobile Web results in an error. Summary: When an application is selected to be packaged for distribution on Mobile Web, an error is shown Steps to Reproduce: 1. Create a new project 2. Click on the Publish button and select the option for Package Mobile Web 3. In the pop up window, select the third option for Create a new project for the new mobile web app 4. Put in a project name and click on Publish (do it at least 2x quickly) A packaging error is shown with the message ""Failed to package project"". Unable to preview mobile web application when launching preview of page. Steps to reproduce: 1. Create a Single Window project from template wizard 2. file URL, and evidently it does not work that way. It is probably easier to extendd Studio than to fix this behavior in Mobile Web. Suggested fix: * When creating a new project as part of the mobile web packaging wizard, create a new default server for use in preview and associate it with that project.. Unable to locate module when launching Mobile Web application. Summary: When a single window template application is selected to be run on Mobile Web Preview on Browser and Mobile Web Preview on Emulator, an error is shown Steps to Reproduce: 1.

Kevin, thoughts?. When RSS Reader or Geocoder are installed from the pane, deleted (without filesystem removal), and reimported into studio, the projects import with a different project name: and instead of Geocoder and RSS Reader. If the user attempts to reinstall the sample from the pane, there will be a fatal git dialog box and the project will disappear from the filesystem. Steps to Reproduce: 1. Install RSS Reader or Geocoder from the samples pane or dashboard links. 2. Delete project from workspace without removing it from the filesystem. 3. Re-import project back into studio from workspace. Expected Result: Project should have same name as before. Actual Result: Project has different name. 4. Install the project again from the samples pane or dashboard links. 5. Press ok, accept the install. Expected Result: Project should be overwritten and a new version of the sample should take its place. Actual Result: Git warning dialog, followed by automatic deletion of project from the OS.. Studio: Kitchen Sink Nook not available in samples. iPhone modules are displayed as not supported when the Titanium SDK version is set to version or newer. This appears to be due to the fact that the manifest file for iPhone modules currently do not include the 'apiversion: 2' entry. The 'apiversion' entry was added for Android modules in Titanium SDK version to indicate that the internal module API had changed. This change only impacted Android modules and it should be checked for Android modules because older versions of Android modules will not work with Titanium SDK version or newer (and vice-versa). This is not the case for iPhone modules (currently). The check for the 'apiversion' tag should ONLY be done for Android modules. It should be ignored for iPhone modules. To test: Create a new Titanium Mobile project Open up and add a module to the project using the modules panel (I used Note the module appears active Edit the module manifest file to raise the apiversion to something like ""3"" in the iOS and Android (current maximum version is 2 for Save and restart Studio. Note that the module now appears greyed out, but should be available for iOS. Steps to reproduce: Create a new Titanium Mobile project Put a breakpoint on one of the ""var"" declarations in Launch the iOS simulator When debugging stops on the breakpoint, note the error as shown in the screenshot. Application ""null"" has been packaged message when starting a server. The command in Studio needs to call out to when cleaning iOS targets in order to ensure that stale information is removed. The exact command that needs to be performed is: We need to call this before deleting the iPhone folder. This bug is the Studio version of TIMOB-8025. Please get cbarber to test and resolve that ticket when complete.. Trying to open the from an FTP server returns this error: This caused the attached logfile to be generated in the Titanium log. Steps to reproduce: 1. Create a Titainum Mobile project. 2. Upload the Mobile project to an FTP server. 3. Attempt to open the Actual result: An editor opens showing the above error. Expected result: You should be able to open the but it will be treated as an ""external"" so some editing options are disabled.. Remove as Android SDKs requirement for Android development. Description: On one of our newer installations of Studio, the Android SDK is properly configured to support SDKs. The Dashboard configuration page shows an incorrectly configured Android SDK. In comparing the listed text to the actual configuration: We were missing the SDK. The result is that imported samples could be run as expected in the emulator, but no project could have the deployment target set during creation of afterward. The tooltip text lists similar requirements, see attached image. Steps to reproduce: 1) Configure a system with ANY supported SDK Android SDK (Android - 2) Launch Studio, add the Android SDK path in the studio preferences 3) On the dashboard, check the configuration utility's report on the usability of the Android SDK Result: If you don't have both and SDKs, the configuration is determined to be incorrect Expected: Only is installed (and required) by default. Add Titanium platform support info in CA for Titanium namespaces. Currently, we warn users about not installing Xcode Once that support is in, we'll need to remove that warning: new text: We also need to update the sdk info links for the Xcode download to. Please try running the same command Titanium Studio does on the command line: Do you get the same result?. Change Studio to reference new platform -clean option. Once TIMOB-7652 is complete, we'll need to switch to using that mechanism over the current one. Note, this only will work on SDKs above so if the SDK is less than that version, we need to use the old system for now.. Our current JS CA implementation queries the index file for the entire project. This means that we show content assist for all JS files in a project when bringing up CA in a JS file. We now detect ""require"" invocations and store the required module name in the index. We also have the ability to filter index query results by a list of documents. Using these two items together, we should be able to filter JS CA by required files only. Note, that we may not want this as a default behavior for web projects. So, for the time being, we should implement this for the TiMobile nature only.. Using the sample snippets in the Epic containing this ticket, we will need to create documentation that shows that code being scriptdoc'ed for use as a module. We need to update the wiki pages here: *. Suggest we may wish to keep ""Edit Profile"" available ( as that is the third link currently available of and also currently present on the dashboard.. The available packages in will change names and pricing of those will be on a per-app basis. Hence a paid subscriber might have more than one package, so we can no longer display the user's plan level on the dashboard. Instead we should just display the following: a link labeled ""My Account"" pointing to the user's account. Titanium MobileWeb when previewed against an internal browser shows empty content. The current iOS dashboard configuration screen is a confusing regarding min max versions of SDKs. So lets display which iOS versions are compatible with this and below that have a link that points to here : Regarding the actual text, here is a proposal: An iOS SDK is missing. Titanium supports the following range of iOS versions: Min iOS version: Max iOS version: Algorithm to calculate this: if inclusive ' ', leave the versions as is. if exclusive '(', subtract .1 from the last position, and add .X to the end, (We can ignore the exclusive lower bound case at the moment: unlikely we'll need it) Button ('install or update iOS SDK"") Note: If you intend to develop mobile applications using an earlier version of the Titanium Mobile SDK , please consult the Titanium Compatibility Matrix. (this is the link shown above). Description: Currently the configuration utility performs a check of iOS platforms to see if is available. From what I've been told this is non-exclusive, meaning would be shown to satisfy this check, but with coming out, the upper bound needs to be corrected. 1) Evaluate the logic here: 2) Note the iOS platform check as including and < Result: Only iOS SDKs would meet with success Expected: Logic evaluates based on target supported iOS SDKs. Add a new platform to the dashboard (add an icon with and without a questionmark) Mobile web will show a question mark on first launch, or first time it appears Clicking on the question mark will show the information in the following panels (based on There will be a link which opens Preferences General Web Browser, and another link which opens Mobile Web previewing works best in modern HTML 5-compliant browsers. We recommend you configure your Studio browsers before working on mobile web projects: 1) Click to open browser preferences. 2) Add one or more entries for . Alternately, if your default system browser meets one these requirements, you can leave the preference alone. 3) Save and close the preference. Text to replace for OS X: Safari 5+, Chrome 10+, or Firefox 10+ Linux: Chrome 10+ or Firefox 10+. At the top of the ""Register Existing"" and right below the ""Publish"" screen dropdown, add the following text: ""TestFlight allows developers to publish beta builds of applications to a group of users organized into a This might need to be contributed as part of an extension point or interface.. Create test plan for module additions. It appears Xcode has changed the location of developer tools. In particularly, it's packaged as a single application, with the platforms and command-line tools installed underneath. Homebrew has a function that finds the proper path prefix: no longer seems to be installed by default, so note that we have to have a fallback here Else check if Developer exists. If so, use that. Else ask spotlight where Xcode is (mdfind if that succeeds, append to that location. Type names missing from JavaScript hover. We moved the SDK check to for demo purposes. Revert this back to by Titanium Studio GA. Add ""release notes"" overview to Titanium SDK update dialogs. As in Studio we previously prompted for user updates with a custom dialog box containing a browser pointing to a remote URL containing the latest set of release notes, similar to this: but formatted differently. I've attached a screenshot of how 1Password does it, which seems fine. Ideally, this dialog would follow clicking on the yellow toast (though note the case where we had both a SDK and a Studio simultaneous update should handle that gracefully) The SDK and Studio dialogs will be identical, save the URL in the middle. However, we only do the SDK update dialog right now, as we completely control that process.. We can fix the issue, but it seems that the command-line SDK should have an option to clean. Added linked ticket for that idea.. Below is a several simple examples of a CommonJS Module. Add XSD-based Validation for and editors. CSS ""Add Color"" Command places the caret before, not after the inserted color. Please see capture at : Upon invoking the CSS Add Color command, the editor places the caret after the new color code. Steps to Replicate : 1) Open Titanium Studio 2) Open a CSS file 3) Select Color CSS Add Color Actual Results : The caret precedes the new color. Expected Results : The caret should be after the new color.. Error in log file: ""Was unable to add folding position"". JavaScript validation continues to report a syntax error, even after error is corrected. With the introduction of the Snippets View ( we need update the existing snippets to add more context and improve This is accomplished by adding the following fields to Snippets ( category: A name of a category used to group the snippet with other similar snippets. Optional tags: keywords that describe the snippet. Used as means to easily filter snippets. Optional Example: In addition is the entry that defines a grouping for snippets: These additions will make working with snippets much easier for user via the Snippets view The changes are also outlined here (towards the bottom):. 1. Import KS from Samples 2. Compile to device 3. Without cleaning compile to iphone simulator We semi-solved this with TISTUD-697, but we missed a case.. Currently there isn't an way to delete an OpenShift app from within Studio once it is created, and if user runs into issues with creating a new app, exceeding the limit for the number of apps per namespace or trying to create one with one that already exists, and would need to delete an app, they would have to go back to command line with gem to resolve it. Perhaps add a command (using Rubles) for OpenShift to delete an app (by typing in the app name). JSON outline does not update if there is an error in the code. Please see capture at The JSON Outline does not clear if you replace all current content by pasting in syntactically erroneous content. Steps to Replicate : 1) Open Aptana Studio 2) Open JSON file 3) Add content that will register in the Outline 4) Select the entire file and paste in syntactically erroneous content Actual Results : The Outline freezes in its initial state. Expected Results : The Outline should clear when this happens. Proposed solution: Display a message (similar to a status message) inside the outline view with the message ""The outline view is due to syntax errors in the document"". suggestion is that the message is noticeable, but not obtrusive, as it may appear during normal editing.. Allow snippets to be scoped by project type. Have this code in a JS file: The result of this CA is: In this case, the Titanium Mobile ruble is contributing a snippet which does not apply inside a regular JS project. Suggest is we have some way to allow snippets to be scoped based on project natures titanium mobile), or perhaps a more generic mechanism jquery snippets enabled in a ""jquery"" project, where there is no corresponding nature) Suggestion is to add a meta scope of:. Titanium Studio: Improved error reporting in preferences window for invalid Android SDK. Create test plan for Snippets view. This involves taking the current built participant reviewing the test plans and unit tests, and performing the tests. Current wiki: Suggested approach: Review the unit tests. See if they exercise the functionality. Run them through Emma to check for code coverage All tests are marked as full. The point of a test plan is to break functionality into smoke, acceptance and full levels of test. If the tester can't figure out these coverage levels, they need to work with dev to figure it out. An actual description of what ""Build Participant functionality"" is would be helpful if the test plan is going to be run by anyone other than the author. There seems to be multiple features in the test cases Often missing set up steps - For the PHP and Ruby specific test cases, how do we setup our environment to test those test cases? Unclear if it applies to Aptana or Tistudio. Overall, the test cases should be more detailed since the test plan seems to be dealing with different programatic syntax and the test plan needs to clearly define what it is testing. (ignore for now) In the ""Declarations and documentation"" tests, need specific examples for the programatic syntax Document a class, declare a class, declare a function * 1112 - 1115 refer to Aptana Studio. Also the location is Mac-only for the preferences. Unless the testing is Mac only either leave out the menu path or put Linux and Win info too.. Warn before launching in if there are errors in the project. If i type bad javascript and compile, it's not always apparent from the logging what the heck is the issue. We show parse errors in the gutter of the editor and in the problems view. If the project has errors, we pop up a dialog as shown (similar to JDT) warning the user of the error and confirming they wish to continue. There also needs to be a way for the user to reset the preference warning (suggest a single button to reset all checkbox preferences, not one per preference). When developing an Android module, you either need to set the ANDROID NDK environment variable, or set in the of the module Marshall suggested instead that when packaging we call ANT directly (instead of the module build scripts) and pass to the scripts. We can get the preference from TISTUD-952. To test: Create a new Android modules Set the NDK location Package the module. If it succeeds, the test is successful. Incorrect packaging would result in the build failing and prompting a user to specify the NDK path manually.. Force installation of Android NDK if user is doing Android module development. Unsure how to have a conditional install, however, the user does need to have the Android NDK installed before proceeding with building an Android module. Suggest the following: Add the NDK to the file. Locations are available from Download from that website Perhaps install the NDK under the chosen SDK directory, android ndk? Create a Android NDK Home preference in Preferences Titanium Studio Titanium Test for this preference being set when creating an Android module. Update dashboard with new tests Add NDK line in Titanium preferences. We need to restrict the modules selection in the TiApp UI to an API-Level that is enforced on a module. The platform team adds an api-level value into the module's manifest, and will add a into the file of the Titanium SDK. We'll need to read both to find an API level match, and do whatever needs to be done in the UI in order to allow selecting only valid modules, and display warnings when incompatible modules exist in the tiapp. To test: Create a new Titanium Mobile project Open up and add a module to the project using the modules panel (I used Note the module appears active Edit the module manifest file to raise the apiversion to something like ""3"" (current maximum version is 2 for Save and restart Studio. Note that the module now appears still available, but should appear greyed out Note that this change is only relevant to Android. iOS does not care about apiversions. As demonstrated in , for some reason some browsers, in certain circumstances, will not download files with filenames that contain spaces. Please consider renaming the Windows and OSX install packages in to Update to respect the new names. Paul, I'll leave this one to you or Chad to close.. Show error in problems view if a project has an incorrect configuration. Run git clean on build subfolders during project clean. Anytime you do a on a Titanium mobile project, the and directories have any existing files deleted. This is bothersome when those files are the easiest way to ensure that the and paths exist when storing a project on git. If they don't exist, a user attempting to build the project will get an error on their first attempt. It would be ideal if, when a is performed on a project, that any existing files were left untouched in those directories. Running a git clean should restore the project to the state it was check in with.. In order to create a better validation experience for and files suggestion is to create a DTD for them. Note that spans both mobile and desktop applications. I don't know if it's feasible to create a DTD that spans both cases, or if it should be split into two.. Rework info message for 'native' and 'implements' from Mozilla JS validator. In my JavaScript source code when editing in Titanium Studio, if you use the words 'native' and 'implements' as function names, it gives me a warning of a syntax error in the syntax highlighting, but everything compiles and runs fine. This is because those items are future reserved words. We should rework the messages as , and say something like ""Native is a future JavaScript reserved word. Its usage may not be compatible with all JavaScript runtimes"". Currently, when Studio first runs, a ""configuring python interpreters"" dialog comes up. Instead, we should integrate this dialog withe the current dashboard configuration process. It would allow for checking and configuring Python interpreters through the Dashboard configuration actions. Add check for python configuration to current dashboard check * If check fails, add button that pops up the same dialog as shown now. Note that for Aptana Studio, this would require us implementing a similar dashboard as Titanium Studio so that we may perform the same checks there.. Add dashboard support for checking GIT (windows only). Configuring GIT should be allowed on a Windows OS through the installation of Portable GIT. Add check for git configuration to current dashboard check * If check fails, add button that pops up the same dialog as shown now (which ultimately does the installation) Note that for Aptana Studio, this would require us implementing a similar dashboard as Titanium Studio so that we may perform the same checks there.. Description: While evaluating the impact of using git-managed projects in Studio, I encountered a situation where the git project's was missing the deployment targets in the xml view. The targets were checked in the ""overview"" view however. A quit and relaunch of studio then populated the deployment targets in the xml view, and removed the checkmarks in the ""overview"" view. Before studio quit and relaunch: After relaunch: Steps to reproduce: 1) Import KS-iPad from 2) Build from device to populate build folder 3) In terminal, switch branches to master with git checkout -f master 4) Switch back to with ""git checkout 5) Examine Result: The does not have the Expected: overview matches xml detail and deployment targets are selected and ""true"". Change ""Deploy"" tool tip to ""Publish"". For clarity of terminology, please change the tool tip for the ""deploy"" menu to be ""publish"". This better fits with the current usage of that menu and the items inside. Correct references to ""Deploy"" in wiki documentation. We should be opening the file after we generate a mobile module project, as a means of getting users started more easily.. Open file in editor for user after generating mobile module project. When a run debug configuration is created, we need the ability to pass additional command-line arguments to the android emulator. As an example, the -scale argument in order to use skins whose full scale causes them to be larger than the screen you are running on. For example, I am using the Motorola MD860 skin for the Atrix 4G whose screen is 960 pixels high. The resulting emulator window is some 1200 pixels high but my screen is only 900 pixels high. If you run the AVD from the AVD Manager, it offers the option to run with a particular screen size which uses the -scale argument. We need the capability to do this in Studio. I would recommend simply adding an extensible option to specify any additional command line arguments. The standard Eclipse launch configurator allows this on the Target tab but that appears to be disabled in Studio. Please re-add the tab and allow those arguments to be passed to the emulator. Note: This can only be allowed on SDK versions that support the this won't work on but should work on. Add preference for default settings on android run debug configurations (API & Screen size). Request Enable Studio to change the default settings used when it creates an Android Run or Debug Configuration for the first time on a project. Currently, Studio installation creates new Android configurations using API: and Screen: WVGA854. This is an inconvenient that emulator screen size is too big for laptop screens, taking up over half the display, so this change the default to something smaller. Also be able to control which API is used by default. info To customize device resolution density from command line: emulator -avd HVGA800 -scale 96dpi 160 Further info can be found here as well: Suggest creating a child page of the titanium preference page to hold that information and allow the user to set it.. Allow for the creation of mobile module projects. This is an umbrella ticket to be split into smaller tasks. iOS Steps: We need the following: New Titanium Module wizard (allowing user to choose iOS Android or both) Import an existing module project During wizard, ask user if they wish to create a shell test project to act as a test harness for testing the module to compile the module and deploy it (this would mean deploying it to the root titanium install directory on disk so that other apps can use it) Ability in other editors to include modules in your project (these could be already installed ones, or ones from your workspace) Create documentation for module (tidocs to JSCA file) Upload finished module project to marketplace. Chromium: Ctrl+W and Ctrl+Shift+W do nothing when focus is on the embedded browser. Add Support for debugging on Android devices (tethered). we have the following issues open for ios and android to add debugging support for device Enhancement request - Add Support for debugging on device once these are addressed studio would need to add UI to support the features. This ticket is only for the Android side of the equation. The task here is to agree on a discovery mechanism with platform. It might be that we pass the IP address Studio is listening on to the device, or we might have the device broadcast and Studio would listen. After that, the rest of the process is identical to the current mechanism. Additional ADB info:. Cannot right-click on a folder in project explorer. Add unit tests for SDKLocator, SDKManager, SDKEntity classes. Allow users to add new platform targets after project creation. Description: While testing studio, it was noted that new deployment targets could not be added to an existing project. For example, a project created for an Android deployment had the iOS targets grayed out. It is possible to manually edit to set targets to true. This enables the ""run on simulator"" for iOS, and in my test was able to launch the project in the simulator. Steps to reproduce: 1) Create a new Titanium Mobile project in Studio 2) Select ""Android"" as the only deployment target 3) When the project is created, open and note that only Android is available to 4) Open the pure xml tab of and set deploy target for iOS to ""true"" Result: Your project can be launched in the simulator, but installed on device will launch then quit and has no icon. Expected: Either no ability to add or remove targets after project creation or the ability to add with the same default structure as during project creation. Suggested solution: Call platform script to initialize new platform. This would (most likely) add another build folder, and copy several resources into a specific location Validate project specifics as per what we would do in the new project wizard * Suggest we don't remove platform the user we can't remove platform support for a project if they try to uncheck a box.. A comment with security level 'Developers' was removed.. h1. Feature Support specifying the ""Abstracted LCD density"" of an Android Virtual Device in the ""Debug Configuration"" in Titanium Studio. Also add the field to the Titanium preference page to support a default value. Right now, only the API, Screen, and Log level can be changed. By adding this additional field, it would be easier for developers to test multiple densities. h2. Associated Helpdesk Ticket. Allow a ruble to contribute the image for a template. Outline window doesn't always show javascript object outlines for self-invoking functions. Running the BlackBerry emulator is similar to running the Android Emulator. The option is launched from the ""play"" menu in App Explorer and Project Explorer, and automatically appears for all projects with BlackBerry as a deploy target, The following options need to exist for the launch configuration: Filter: This filters the amount of log output in the developer window based on the level selected. Info is default, Debug shows more than Info, and Trace shows more than Debug. With Blackberry Debug is normally as low as you need to go, Trace will have a lot of simulator messages that won't be useful in normal circumstances. Clear SDCard: Clear the sdcard on the next simulator launch. If you receive a while launching your app, you should stop the simulator, and click this on the next launch. One the emulator launches, suggest showing a pop-up (which may be dismissed in future runs) that shows the user how to start their app: ""Locate your application in the ""Downloads"" section of the main Blackberry menu. You can do this by hitting the Blackberry key on the simulator, selecting the ""Downloads"" folder, and selecting your. Replace colons in project names with underscore characters. It currently shows Aptana, Inc when hovering over the installer image. Would be 5 points if it is already in correct format.. Update the verified publisher in Windows installer to Appcelerator. Change ""Install Titanium SDK From to ""Install Specific Titanium Add radio button: Install from Update stream: Cascading drop-downs ""release"" stream: (filter on OS) ** ""continuous integration master"" stream: (we may need to work with platform to either a) regularize the format or b) allow for the extension point to apply some regex xpath to the JSON to grab build info). Create new Titanium Studio Splash Screen. There is a placeholder image for now but needs replacement. We can replace the existing size, or use a new different size, but we'll just need to configure a few new options:. Add iframe for Ad Content to screen. Retrieve content for frame from similar location as in TiDev. Assume some static content for offline mode.. Avoid force update if studio doesn't find the required cli information in the file If doesn't have required CLI information, studio is forcing to update everything. Expected: Avoid force update, means, ""remind me later button"" on the update wizard should be enabled. This is the effect of TISTUD-7705. Create Appcelerator studio error reporting strack trace model. Subtask from TISTUD-7697: The wizard suggests that you select the targets here but deselecting doesn't affect the actual listed targets in the It just determines the choices given in the next step. So the wizard should either remove the unselected targets (and populate this list by reading the available targets in the Xcode project) or it might as well skip this step and show the next step right away for all targets. It completely make sense and keep everything in one page, as we hardly have 2 targets.. Eclipse can only send errors, similar to that, we should identify our own error patterns from studio.. Identify the error patterns from Appcelerator Studio. Prototype Error reporting feature with Appcelerator Studio. Update with the new version * URL:. If you run ""npm ls -g appcelerator"" when a pre-release version is installed, ""npm ERR! code 1"" is returned. If you run ""npm ls -g appcelerator"", ""npm ERR! code 1"" is returned. does not occur Steps to reproduce: Actual: No error should be returned when you run .. Installers: Update with the new version. Windows Installer: Installer should install NodeJS on a clean machine. Appcelerator Studio Windows Installer should install NodeJS on a clean machine.. Add prominent display of ""what you like what can be better"" to solicit feedback. Help Studio Submit a Log in Fill out fields Error reported is: ""Field 'versions' cannot be set"". Since the update of studio (and even before the updated XCode 7 had finished downloading - I still had the previous XCode installed), no simulator ""option"" appears in the launch pad area (see graphic below). No amount of reinstalling (done this twice now) is helping. I can confirm that there is indeed a simulator resident at: and then after showing package contents, in: Shows as per the 2nd graphic attached. appc ti info also reports simulators: Help! UPDATE This problem is only apparent on ALLOY projects.. OS X installer should check for and install correct version. Launching creates a new process without killing the previous one. Failed to publish to MobileIron: No message body writer has been found for response class. Marketing needs to swap out the OpenX javascript code on Ti Studio home tab to the following js code:. When testing Studio, it is difficult to tell what build is included in the installers. Viewing you can't tell what version of Appcelerator Studio is included. 3 suggested changes: Output the version of Studio being packaged in the installer build logs When building the installer, create a companion file called That file is uploaded to On add hover text over the installer links to highlight what version is published there (for those who need to know). If you import a Titanium project with ACS enabled, you will be prompted to change or leave the existing keys. But the choice is not clear. Create a project with ACS enabled; need to use Titanium stack (Titanium Studio: CLI: SDK: Note the ACS keys in the Next, in Appc Studio, open Studio dashboard, , and select You will be prompted to replace keys, but the dialog is confusing.. Import: ACS - Improve UI in Prompting Dialog. Once the download of the prerequisites or studio starts there is no way to stop the installation. For the studio, once the installation starts only the back button is enabled which allows the user to go back to the previous steps but no option to cancel installation unless force quit is attempted. So it would be good to have a cancel button to allow the user to terminate download once it has started.. Studio: Mac: Options relating to Windows projects appear in Studio on Mac. Sign OS X application with ""Version 2"" of developer signature. From Apple: Beginning November 1, 2014, apps submitted to the Mac App Store must be signed with signatures created with OS X Mavericks or later (v2 signatures). Apps without v2 signatures will be automatically rejected on upload. If you build code with an older version of OS X, use OS X Mavericks or later to sign your app and create v2 signatures using the codesign tool. Structure your bundle according to the signature evaluation requirements for OS X Mavericks or later. Considerations include: Resources should not be located in directories where the system expects to find signed code.  *. Description: The test machine is having the installation as mentioned in the environment. Running the iOS application with iPhone Retina (4-inch 64-bit) simulator by setting ti SDK to in gives an error ""invalid device id value"".

BlackBerry: Installing through BlackBerry SDK through Studio does not install Momentics correctly. MobileWeb: Unable to launch mobileweb projects in Android Emulator. Android Modules can not be created in Windows machine. But module can be created using CLI. h5. Steps To Reproduce 1. Launch the studio on windows machine 2. Create an android module h5. Actual Result: Module can not be created. It fails with an error message. Please see the attachment for more info. Studio log is also attached. h5. Expected Result: Module should be created without any issues. Error:. From Weve been running Java 8 with it since 8 was released. Weve heard mention that we need specific versions like 6 or 7 installed by various parties before, but traditionally that was because of Android limitations. There is instead likely a `ti info` bug like TISTUD-6909 but on the iOS side. Somehow the CLI is giving us different JSON values than weve traditionally received Numbers where they used to be strings, objects where they used to be arrays). We couldnt reproduce it locally for 6909, but were able to test and fix based on the users ti info output. In this case, we are guessing we used to get an array and now get an object, but without the output we dont know where. Please run: So we can generate a test case for it, and fix it.. Platform Configuration window shows incorrect version after installation of Android SDK. h5. To reproduce 1. Import an existing Alloy project(in my case it was Alloy) 2. Change Titanium SDK to the latest(?) one and save changes. h5.

This extends the previous functionality from TISTUD-6692: If you hold down Cmd and hover the mouse over the titleid attribute for first label, or L() macro on second label, They are not turning into hyperlinks.. When a project under the organization: studio, it starts creating the project and then when it is more than half way in creating the necessary folder, it hangs. However, project is successfully created under organization. Steps to reproduce: 1. Go to File New Project 2. Enter Project Name and select organization as 3. Click Finish Actual Result: Starts creating the project and then when it is more than half way in creating the necessary folder, it hangs. When the red square beside the progress bar is clicked it stops but the 'new project wizard' cannot be closed. Studio then becomes unresponsive and it has to be forcefully quit. Expected Result: project must be successfully created.. Clearing invalid proxy login, still does not allow the user to login to the studio and shows a message that the server is unreachable. This is not a regression as it also happens in Appcelerator studio Steps to reproduce: 1. Click proxy set up 2. Enter the following in the proxy setup host: 3. Click ok 4. Enter your credentials and login to studio the proxy settings 6. Login to the studio Actual Result: 4. ""Login server is currently unreachable"" message is displayed 5.

Steps to Reproduce This should be a subtask to : After Installing the current Beta version of TS (Titanium Studio, build: I was able to see the fix for Auto Code Completion, but it doesn't work 100% :) It is tru that you can now type and get the next LVL of API's but after creating a new object, the Auto Code completion stops working inside the object. So You cant see what properties the object have. Screen 2: Screen 3: h3. Actual Result No Auto Code Completion h3. Expected Result Auto Code Completion. Object property content assist missing inside object declaration. Intellisense Auto Code Completion is not working. h3. Steps to Reproduce I updated my Titanium Studio to and since that day the Intellisense hasn't been working. I just spend another 3 hours trying to find a solution, but now I'm giving up. I've tried to remove TS and reinstall it, but everytime I open it and start to write code the auto completion of TS SDK is not showing any API after the .UI API. So if I type T, then I can see option for API's such as Ti. Titanium. , And If I use Ti. then I can see all API related to Ti, but they are grey and say 'No description available'. If I select then I can't se any API for creating new object. such as createView, and so on. h3. Actual Result No Intellisense Auto Code Completion h3. Expected Result Intellisense Auto Code Completion. Themes: Unable to set theme to 'Dark'. BlackBerry: Authentication failed.

We are deprecating FastDev in SDK Thus, we should remove the option to launch with FastDev enabled. BlackBerry: update prevents Studio from using BB NDK. h3. Description: BlackBerry has changed the flow of how we can get and install the BB 10 NDK. This prevents Studio users (and in particular, new BB users) from installing and using BB support. h4. Previously: We get the BB 10 NDK from the BB developer website link: provided in the appcelerator docs for BB. Install the NDK manually. Point studio to the NDK folder installed in the above step in preferences. h4. The new flow: When we go to the link to download the NDK, there is no way we can download just the discreet NDK. We instead download the Momentics IDE The Momentics installs the NDK in new locations with different paths than before. Referencing the path inside Studio prompts the user with an error about missing directories with prefix '' h3. Related They also have changed the flow to get the signing keys. Now it is done through Momentics or through the website. In both cases you have to register for blackberry ID & then only can get the signing keys. Studio Building workspace every time I save a file. Tizen: Tizen target greyed out. Description: 1. First make sure you have the tizen sdk installed & have configured tizen sdk in the studio 2. Go to create new app in titanium or appcelerator studio 3. Select the appropriate type of app classic or alloy 4. Notice the tizen deployment target Actual result: 1. The tizen target is greyed out Expected Results: 1. The tizen target should be enabled after its configured in studio prefs. Android: App log messages aren't getting filtered. BlackBerry: Allow BB project creation with spaces and dots in the app name. Right now Studio does not allow us to create an app with space or certain characters in the app name. This issue has been fixed from the sdk side & we can create apps with spaces & in the app name using the CLI.. Set cname does not appear to get called. Debugger: First debug session results in no variables in stack view. Debugger: Android SDK default version is not being saved on Windows. unexpected characters in the console, building the project on Linux and Windows. CLI: New Project: non-existing sdk error message not formatted. This is a could not happen in Studio Test Steps: New Project. project name. Finish. the creation of the project folder, cancel it by clicking on the red square at the bottom. Observe the error. Screenshots and logs attached.. The Alloy templates should be displayed as follows (no beta description): Alloy The tag category and the template should also no longer include the word ""beta"". ""Problem Occured"" build error if project imported using File Import General Existing Folder as New Project Next. Test Steps: Latest studio. an android device. a Titanium Mobile android project with GA SDK . click on the project and select debug debug configuration create a new configuration for android device run. Expected Result: SDK Error is an expected behavior but it should display SDK version or above.. CLI: console build log needs to indicate which Titanium CLI is being called. Titanium Studio: Android Updater prompt which appears at the bottom right hand side of studio displays 'OK' which is unnecessary.. Content Assist: 'Testing' function info popup in is showing all three parameters as (Object, object, object).. Studio: Installation issues with shown even after complete installation of ACS. Content overlay - icon, description etc for Denso turbo brand. Editing and saving while project is indexing hangs Studio. About box shows instead of correct text for non-English versions of Studio. This is not a regression issue. Steps To Reproduce: 1. Download studio installer and upgrade it to 2. Delete plugin files from folder. 3. Go to Help Check for Titanium Updates. From the window install, alloy, CLI and acs updates. Actual: After successful installation of all plugins, File New option does not appear. Expected: File New option must appear.. Deleting plugins from and reinstalling causes project option to disappear from File New menu. ""Failed to install Titanium"" and ""failed to install ACS"" errors are coming during updates installation. Updates: add update stream release notes docs. Alloy: Updates: add Alloy update stream release notes docs. During clean install of Studio, user is bombarded with a number of errors for Alloy and NodeJS. Error in logs when logged off and logged back in studio.. The app icon is an important identifier for a 360 app. Users should be able to update hte app icon via the editor Add a browse button allowing the user to pick a new icon * Restrict the icon to standard app store guidelines.. When Preferences Titanium iOS Configure button is pressed, nothing appears to happen. In reality, the dashboard is opening in the background to the configure page. I would recommend removing the Configure button because it is out of context. h3. Steps to Reproduce: Go to Preferences Titanium iOS and click the Configure button. h3. Actual Result: Dashboard configure opens in the background. From a usability perspective it appears as though nothing happens. h3. Expected Result: Either the button isn't there at all because it doesn't appear to do anything, or it opens a wizard that would normally be opened using the dashboard (if possible). Note that Configure buttons exist for all platforms and perform a similar result, even BlackBerry which does not have a dashboard configure entry. All platform Configure buttons apply to this ticket.. Update Titanium Mobile HTML template with new iPhone 5 splash image. Add validation build participant to highlight deprecated Titanium Mobile code. Once we have the deprecated flag for more JSCA members, we need to validate and warn about deprecated usage on both build and reconcile. Ideally, we can show the items similarly to how they appear in Java (with a and on hovering over the warning, show the description of the item (which will include the deprecation text). Prevent users from using a capital letter in module name or module ID. While creating a new android or mobile web module,if the 'Project name' field contains any capital letter, then it is giving error of the message and studio logs are attached with the bug. Steps to reproduce 1. Create a new titanium mobile module project and select android as deployment target. 2. Give project name - and module id - .Click next and then finish Expected result 2. Android module should get created. Actual result 2. It creates module with many files missing. Gives an error message for the same. Snapshot attached.. Check version strings from the browser settings vs the versions in sdk info and return results. Check the version strings in the name vs the versions in sdk info. The version string is appended to the end of the browser name. Return a similar success value to iosSdk with and. If on Mac or Windows, run the configuration in TISTUD-1414 and TISTUD-1738 if there are no browsers configured (if not, you would notice no browser names have version s attached). Related to TISTUD-1414. As discussed, we need to include the version of the browser in question as part of the browser name (see image for example) Ideally, this value would be dynamic, but that appears to be impossible given the current UI. In the case where the user upgrades the browser later, the suggestion is that when the user re-runs the configuration step to auto-search, we replace the version s of the existing browsers with the newer version. firefox -v. Create build participant to auto-compile embedded ACCS service when changes occur. For an integrated project, where the client and server are the same thing, we need to update the bindings for the embedded service when the service changes Watch for changes in the file If a change happens, re-run the compilation step to update the bindings.. By default, the first item in the first group is selected, and the corresponding description is shown. This should be the ""Alloy blank"" template for Titanium Mobile projects, assuming they have alloy installed. We have a way of defining groups or categories of templates, but there is no user-friendly name for them such that it could be displayed to the user. Add something that would allow us to group templates as shown in the mockup.. Add button to call new action to run project created in above step (APSTUD-4801), greyed out until a project is created, or there is at least one project in the workspace. If the user happened to close and reopen the dashboard, the ""just created"" project might be lost. So, we always run the most recent project based on timestamp.. See for more information.. If on Mac and Windows, the check described in TISTUD-2187 will be run on dashboard open with the other platform configuration options If there are compatible browsers, indicate the user is good to go If there are no compatible browsers, or you are on Linux, indicate the set of required browsers. Add a button to refresh the check (if it failed). Rename the first tab in the Dashboard to ""Get Started"" Update the wiki documentation to reference the new tab name (. ",366,15004,87980

For example: 'CUSTOM'); This is a regression introduced in Studio This did not affect Studio Steps to Reproduce: 1. Run code in iOS Simulator: Actual Result: Custom log does not display. Expected Result: Custom log should display as CUSTOM Note: The Android log levels display correctly.. It appears the console view log level is set to whatever the run configuration was that first launched this view.. Android Emulator: run config console level ignored on subsequent deployments. Android Emulator console log level is always set to the run config setting used to first launch the console process. Steps to Reproduce: 1. Create and run an android project in the emulator with the run configuration log level set to TRACE using code: 2. Edit run configuration to log level ERROR and redeploy project. Actual Result: TRACE+ levels log to console. Expected Result: ERROR level should log to console, as per the current run configuration.. Titanium Studio: Progress View: 'Remove All Finished Operations' fails to remove operations, adds them back if they are gone. In the progress view, pressing the double x ('Remove All Finished Operations') will not remove the operations. If the operations are removed then the double x is pressed, they will re-appear. This is a regression. Works as expected in Steps to reproduce: 1. Create Multiple Projects 2. Open Progress window in 3. Run the projects in Emulator or Simulator and close the 4. List of completed process is generated in ""Progress"" Window 5. Click on ""XX"" (Remove All Finished Project) 6. See Expected Result 6. 7. Close progress view processes one by one by pressing cross ""x"" (Remove From View) icon on right 8. The processes should remove properly 9. Press ""XX"" (Remove All Finished Project) 10. See Expected Result 10. Actual Result: (Remove All Finished Project) does nothing. 10. ""XX"" (Remove All Finished Project) brings back all processes that were removed previously. Expected Result: 6. Pressing ""XX"" (Remove All Finished Project) should remove all processes from the progress view. 10. There should be no list of project in the ""Progress"" view area.. During an SDK update, if the extraction process is canceled, there is no longer an error message generated. This is a regression. This worked in It is worth noting (not part of the regression) that the partially extracted SDK remains in the SDK folder, resulting in an invalid SDK. When the SDK is in this invalid state: It is still selectable by titanium projects, and if it is a stable release, it will not be recognized as needing an update. Steps to Reproduce: 1. Download any version of the SDK using a method such as: Help Check for Titanium SDK Updates or Help Install Specific Titanium 2. During the extraction process (which occurs after the process), press 'Cancel'. Actual Result: No error dialog, no error logs. Expected Result: Error dialog pop-up and error logs.. If the Dashboard Android Configuration Wizard is run without having the JAVA HOME variable set, Studio provides no indication it needs to be set. There is only a pop-up indicating Android was downloaded successfully. Note that studio automatically detects JDK to run, but it does not forward this information to the Android SDK tools. There is no log info. This is not a regression. This is a usability issue. Steps to Reproduce: 1. Make sure JDK is installed. 2. Remove JAVA HOME from the Global Environment Variables. 3. Make sure JAVA HOME is no longer active echo %JAVA HOME%, echo $JAVA HOME from the console). 4. Run Titanium Studio. 5. Make sure the Android SDK path is set in the Titanium Studio Preferences. 5. Run Dashboard Configure Android Actual Result: A pop-up appears indicating Android was downloaded successfully every time Update is run. Expected Result: Either the Android SDK Update utility should run, Titanium Studio should set JAVA HOME, or Titanium Studio should prompt the user to set JAVA HOME.. Dashboard: Configure: Android: Improve OS Global Environment Variable detection. unhandled event loop exception when changing theme. log attached. I could not reproduce this issue, it is intermittent. Unknown if this is a regression. In this particular case, I was changing from the Aptana Studio theme to the Aptana Studio theme. Steps to Reproduce: 1. Open Preferences Titanium Studio Themes. 2. Change the theme using the drop-down menu. Actual Result: unhandled event loop exception in studio log. Expected Result: No errors in studio log.. In Preferences Titanium Studio Titanium Titanium SDK Home, if you enter an invalid path by removing the last two characters), then add in a valid path add the last two characters back), studio will not re-validate the path. There is no log info. This is a regression. This does not occur in Studio Steps to Reproduce: 1. Open Titanium Studio. 2. Go to Preferences Titanium Studio Titanium. 3. Edit the Titanium SDK Home path to make it invalid delete the last two characters of text from the path). Studio should display an error. 4. Edit the Titanium SDK Home path to make it valid again re-add the last two characters of text from the path). Actual Result: The error remains, the path has not been re-validated. However, the changes can be saved, and the error goes away on preferences menu re-open. Expected Result: The Titanium SDK path should immediately re-validate and the error should go away.. When importing a project with git information, studio freezes This is intermittent and difficult to conclusively regression test. Steps to Reproduce: 1. Import KitchenSink from using Existing Titanium Project. Actual Result: Studio unresponsive in Activity Monitor, spinning beach ball instead of arrow cursor, Studio not receiving user events. Expected Result: Project should import and git information should display in Project Explorer.. If a module is installed to project using Help Install Titanium Module, the module is not added to the This is a new fail case, as the install feature did not exist before. If a module is packaged to project, it is included in the There is no log info. Steps to Reproduce: 1. Create a new Titanium Mobile project. 2. Create a new Titanium Module project. 3.

When trying to setup Android inside Titanium Studio, the wizard fails showing a window with the following error message: ""NLS missing message: in: OK"" I managed to install the SDK manually, but I get the same error message when I click the UPDATE button. This is a regression from This does not occur in. Closing as Fixed. Studio: SDK: OS: Snow Leopard Devices Tested: Android Emulator. setting runtime to rhino then back to v8 results in v8 xml tag in when it should be default. run configuration menu should open last used run configuration for the selected project in app explorer. The source option is context dependent, so it appears when it should.. Top menu bar receives events on Linux when other menu windows Preferences, About, Search) are open. This can result in multiple preference windows being launched. This is not a regression. This does not affect Windows 7 or Snow Leopard. This does not affect Eclipse on Ubuntu. Steps to Reproduce: 1. Open studio. 2. Open a menu window Preferences, Search). 3. Click on the top menu bar File, Edit, Expected Result: The top menu bar should not receive any click events. Actual Result: The top menu bar can receive events. However, the main editor frame is correctly blocked from receiving events. As a consequence, many info windows can be launched multiple times Search, About). However, the main preferences window can only have one instance.. Editor: changing file type then reopening does not reflect new file type. ""Search Search"" and ""Search File"" bring up same menu. Titanium Studio: Editor: reopening open project file via Project Explorer Local Filesystem results in duplicate mirror file in editor. If a file that is open in the editor is opened again using the Project Explorer Filesystem, there is a resulting mirror copy of the file in the studio editor. This is not a regression. There is no log info. Steps to Reproduce: 1. Create a new project. 2. Open if it isn't open already from the Project Explorer project folder. 3. Go to Project Explorer Local Filesystem, navigate to (the same file) and open it. Expected Result: The original open version of the file should gain focus. Actual Result: Another copy of the same file will open in the editor resulting in two duplicate open files. Edits to one file are mirrored in real-time to edits in the other file.. Titanium Studio: App Explorer: opening a project in Project Explorer changes selected project in App Explorer. When a project is opened after being closed in the Project Explorer, the App Explorer selected project is updated to the recently opened project. It is expected the selected project in the App Explorer would only change if it is deleted or manually changed. However, the App Explorer selected project is not updated (correctly) if a new project is created. This is not a regression. There is no log info. Steps to Reproduce: 1. Create two projects. 2. In the App Explorer, select the first project. 3. In the Project Explorer, select the second project. 4. Close the second project using Project Close. 5. Open the project using Project Open (reselect project if Project menu commands do not update). 6. Navigate to the App Explorer. Expected Result: The first project should be selected (the first one that was selected). Actual Result: The second project is selected (the one that was recently opened).. Project Open, and Project Close command availability are not updated in real time for projects in the Project Explorer. The old project options are still available Close is available if the project is already closed). Re-clicking the project in the explorer will update the Project menu options. This is not a regression. There is no log info. Fail Cases: 1. Project Explorer: Cannot open a newly closed project. 2. Project Explorer: Cannot close a newly opened project. Note: Project Explorer: Cannot close a freshly created project. - This is an invalid case as has focus. Steps to Reproduce: 1. Click a project in Project Explorer to manually refresh Project menu options. 2. Click Project Close to close project. 3. Click Project. Expected Result: Project Open should be available. Actual Result: Open is not available. If the project is re-clicked, it will become available. 4. Re-Click project in Project Explorer to manually refresh Project menu options. 5. Click Project Open to open project. 6. Click Project. Expected Result: Project Close should be available. Actual Result: Close is not available. If the project is re-clicked, it will become available.. Titanium Studio: Project Explorer: Close Project and Open Project not updated until re-click on project. Multiline Search: find should jump to string matches when scope is set to open files. Titanium Studio: Multiline Search: enable horizontal scrolling in search and replace boxes. In the search and find text areas, vertical scrolling by mouse scroll) is enabled, but not horizontal scrolling. This impairs the functionality of the fields because longer text lines cannot be easily navigated. The only way to scroll horizontally is to use the highlight functionality of the cursor (not ideal). Screenshot attached. Steps to Reproduce: 1. Open studio, open a js file. 2. Open search bar (command + f on osx). 3. Enter long line of text (longer than the search field itself) into search field. 4. Attempt to scroll horizontally. Expected Result: Search field (and replace field) should scroll horizontally to easily view the entire line of text. Actual Result: Nothing happens. The workaround is to use the highlight or left right arrow functionality of the cursor to drag move left and right.. Titanium Studio: Multiline Search: history and scope icons are inactive, only down arrow displays drop-down list. Search history icon does not function when clicked. Only the small down arrow next to the icon will display the search history drop-down menu. Screenshot attached. This is a valid issue, as this is how the run configuration icons function, in addition to basic usability. This also affects the scope icon. Note: There are two history icons, one for search and one for replace (both fail). Steps to Reproduce: 1. Open studio, open js file (create new project as needed). 2. Activate search (command + f on osx). 3. Click on the history icon (flashlight) or the scope icon. Expected Result: A search history drop-down list should display. Actual Result: The icon blinks. However, the small down arrow next to the icon functions correctly.. Editor: JavaScript Comment Auto-Complete initially fails to recognize preexisting blocks and cursor is incorrectly positioned. When deploying from studio, or manually running a mobileweb app in the android emulator browser, the app will not run and server related errors log to the console when a new AVD is created. Logs attached. This is not a regression, as it does occur in Studio Steps to Reproduce: 1. Delete 2. Create a default mobileweb project. 3. MobileWeb Preview in Emulator. Expected Result: Emulator should launch, emulator browser should load, app should run. Actual Result: Emulator launches, emulator browser does not load. Manually opening the browser and navigating to the app url results in a failed app load.. Titanium Studio: MobileWeb: preview in android emulator initially fails with server errors when AVD is first created. Update the Android distribution wizard launch configuration to allow user to pick from the existing list of certificates (combo box), or to create a new one. The top menu (File, Edit, Window, has randomly ordered elements on Ubuntu This does not occur on Ubuntu Snow Leopard, or Windows 7. Screenshots attached. No log. Steps to Reproduce: 1. Open studio. 2. Look at the top menu. Expected Result: Menu items should be consistent. Actual Result: menu items are random, but do change to the correct configuration on a second check.. In the dashboard, when the ad link at the top is clicked (""Forging Titanium""), and the generic external browser is closed, studio will crash. Log attached. Also occurs in This has only occurred using the ""Forging Titanium"" ad. You must refresh the dashboard until this ad appears. This issue is consistently reproducible. This issue affects Windows and Ubuntu, but I could not reproduce on OS X Snow Leopard. Steps to Reproduce: 1. Open Studio. 2. Open the dashboard. 3. Refresh the dashboard (red appcelerator logo) until the ""Forging Titanium"" ad appears at the top of the dashboard. 4. Click on the link to open a new generic browser with the ad content. 5. Close the browser. Expected Result: The browser should close. Actual Result: Studio hard crashes.. Editor: JavaScript Comment Auto-Complete indentation is inconsistent. Content Assist menu is persistent in the OS if the assist popup info menu has focus by clicking on it). Other OS program windows are now obfuscated by the content assist menu until the focus is shifted back to Titanium Studio proper or the regular content assist menu. Screenshot attached. Note: This is a lesser behavior of the fixed TISTUD-913. Steps to Reproduce: 1. Open Studio and create a new project (or open an existing project). 2. Click in the text editor of (or any .js file). 3. Press control + space to bring up the content assist menu. 4. suggestion list by clicking on it. 5. Click on the secondary popup that appears for that particular content assist item. 6. Open any other program (such as Chrome) and move the other program window over the content assist menu. Expected Result: The content assist menu should disappear behind the other program window, as it should have the same OS hierarchy as Titanium Studio. Actual Result: The content assist menu persists and obfuscates the other program window until the focus shifts back to Studio or a regular content assist item.. Editing labels.. Editing labels.. Titanium Studio: Dashboard: Search and Top Ad open in generic browser with no controls. ACS keys cut off when generated in TiApp Editor. Add Xcode Version Manager.

Delete Global Appcelerator NPM Packages. 2. Install Appcelerator Studio. 3. Edit name of studio application directory to a unique one. 4. Run Studio and accept npm package updates. Result: The updates are locally installed to a folder other than the one studio was run from. See screenshot. Expected Result: The updates are globally installed. Note: If you try to run studio commands that require the npm packages, they will fail. Studio looks here no matter what (and the commands fail): Workaround:. Currently they are spelled 'Blackberry' and 'Mobile Web'. The convention is to spell them 'BlackBerry' and 'MobileWeb'. Test Steps: 1. Invoke Code Processor context menu (or invoke the project run-menu drop-down). Result: Spelling errors. See screenshots.. BlackBerry: update platform strings to current format. This is a regression introduced by TISTUD-1534. The ""Android SDK Version"" drop-down in the Application installer and the App Store distribution launch configuration tabs is displaying the Android SDK version in an un-sorted way (unlike the sorted display under the ""Emulator"" configuration page). We should sort those the same as the emulator.. Submit Ticket: Windows: some characters produce error illegal unquoted character code 13. Missing string translation in the iOS Module creation wizard. Debug and Profile on Device: Android and iOS: log level intermittently not respected in console on launch. This is a clone of TISTUD-4882 to address possible related problematic behavior. Debug on Device: Android and iOS: log level not respected. Sometimes the old console log level is used instead of trace. Note this ticket might be invalid, as we might actually want to use the existing console level. Also note the device run config does not allow the user to existing console. Sample Code (insert breakpoints as needed):. Debugger: breakpoint not hit from start method. Code Analyzer: Warning or Error icons are not displayed in code gutter. Does not affect Change introduced by TISTUD-4841. This looks like a regression that was introduced after we implemented this dialog. The debugger is creating a temporary project when launched in debug mode. When the session is terminated, that project is being deleted, and that's when we get this dialog. Expected: We should only show this dialog for the projects that the user created.. Debug and Profile on Device: Android and iOS: log level changes not respected in console. This does not occur Test Steps: 1. Package iOS App (Ad-Hoc or iTunes). 2. Goto Configuration New Configuration and select the 'Upload debug symbol option' Actual Result: 1. 'Apply' & 'Run' options are active before selecting the 'Uploading debug symbols' checkbox. 2. 'Apply' & 'Run' options are disabled after selecting the 'Uploading debug symbols' checkbox.

Each contributor should use the source-map mechanism to map back and forth source paths and line numbers. See TISTUD-3753.. Hookup standard output (stdout) to Console for BB10 apps (see description). Similar to TISTUD-2944, where we updated the alloy update style sheet, we need to do the same for the modules update style sheet. Right now the text in the module details is large and not consistent. The module JSON file should be updated to direct a release-notes page. This page should later be read by the release notes system and be applied with the same stylesheet we use for the rest.. TiApp Editor: Titanium SDK List Not Updated Until TiApp editor Restart. If the Titanium SDK path is switched to another valid SDK path, the SDK list in the TiApp Editor is not updated in realtime. Studio must be restarted. This does not occur in Studio This is a regression. Steps to Reproduce: 1. Copy full Titanium (sdk) folder to another location. 2. In the Titanium copy, delete a few SDKs (to provide contrast). 3. Open a Titanium Project. Open note the drop-down list of SDKs. 4. Change Preferences Titanium SDK Path to another SDK installation the copy). 5. Open the drop-down list in the again. Actual Result: The SDK list is the same because it wasn't refreshed on Preference change. The TiApp editor must be restarted. Expected Result: SDK list immediately updated as it is in Studio. Make the server Run configuration private. The discussion stemmed from parity on having Run Run menu for project. We decided to implement the following two things: 1. Make the launch configuration for running local server private; 2. Add ""Edit Server under Run menu to allow user to edit the server settings such as port number. NOTE: For now, this ticket only deals with making the launch configuration private. Doesn't look like there is a point in controlling the ACS server port number when the project launch is ignoring it anyway ;) New tickets will be created to deal with the other issues..

Module installation should not allow modules to be corrupt. There's one console line before the two you listed that specifies the alias, can you include that line?. This is related to TISTUD-1817, where we tracked down the locations that opened up a Message dialog from a background thread. A more elegant method of displaying the notification is to use a popup toast to notify the user. The popup should only be used for INFO messages, for Question and Error we should still use the Message dialog Locations that this affects: project packaging module packaging (normal and deploy to project with changes) -Titanium SDK update -Publish -Android SDK update (dashboard). -Replace the textbox with a combo box that contains the list of keystore certificates -Remove the and Browse buttons and replace with an button. The pops up the keystore certificate dialog, which allows the option of create a new keystore or registering an existing one. Add a radio to the dialog that allows the user to specify and existing or new keystore. If an existing one is used, then only the password fields is enabled. Add a Preference page to manage Keystore certificates. We should adopt the Adobe AIR certificate management UI. See attached for Adobe AIR cert. management UI in Studio (we can probably reuse this code) There should be a new Android preference page (similar to iOS), that contains a table of current keystore certificates, and an Add and Remove buttons.

Please submit a bug report through Studio's support and include the relevant code which triggered this error.. Studio displays Ad hoc provisioning profiles incorrectly as ""development"". This causes confusion in the following areas: -Preferences displays the displays the type incorrectly -The iOS distribution wizard displays Apple iTunes, Ad hoc, and development profiles (should only display Apple iTunes and Ad hoc profiles) -The iOS Run on device wizard displays Apple iTunes, Ad hoc, and development profiles (should only display development profiles) Special attention must be made to the way we cache provisioning profiles, since a fix to the SDK will not update the ""type"" of the cached provisioning profiles. We have to trigger a flush of the cache if there is a presence of SDK where previously there wasn't. This is blocked by an SDK bug. Update method to explicitly pass in PlatformType, output location and publish target. For the xcode-select command must be run to ensure properly function of the iOS platform scripts. Running the command can be foreign and difficult for some users. We should display a informative description and link on how to run xcode-select. There should be a linked wiki doc page that describes in further detail on how to run the command. The description should be included in the iOS section of the Titanium preferences. It should state: ""If the desired Xcode installation is not displayed, you will need to run ""sudo xcode-select "" to target a specific installation. More details"". Currently, if a user has both Xcode and Xcode installed, they would have to manually ute xcode-select to switch the Xcode version used for iOS operations. I propose we do the following -Update the Titanium preferences for IOS SDK home to be a combo box -The combo box contains a list of detected Xcode locations -Upon applying the changes, we call the sudo xcode-select -switch command. Running package operations (on multiple platforms) on the same project multiple times causes errors. Since package operations are now public launch you can run multiple configurations in quick succession. This will cause errors since the package operations operate on the build directory. We should queue up the launch configurations so they are sequential, scheduling launches based on the project. Steps: 1. Create a mobile project with iOS, Android and mobile web deployment targets 2. Perform project package for iOS 3. Perform project package for android 4. Perform project package for mobile web 5.

Debug Icon * icon. Refactor the Android wizard page contents so it can be reused in the Launch configuration tab. Add a launch configuration for ""Install on Android Device"", which allows users to specify a android sdk. With the introduction of the Snippets View ( we need update the existing snippets to add more context and improve This is accomplished by adding the following fields to Snippets ( category: A name of a category used to group the snippet with other similar snippets. Optional tags: keywords that describe the snippet. Used as means to easily filter snippets. Optional Example: In addition is the entry that defines a grouping for snippets: These additions will make working with snippets much easier for user via the Snippets view The changes are also outlined here (towards the bottom):.

This applies to theme colors, invasive themes and invasive fonts Snippets view requires two new images - Insert snippet and Navigate to snippet source. These will be provided by our creativity engineer. Add appropriate listeners so the snippets view displays the appropriate contents A selection listener will listen to cursor location changes, and updates the snippet contents to match the cursor context. If there is a mismatch, the snippet is shown with greyed out colors A Bundle listener will listen to bundle to keep the snippets view contents in sync.. Support dragging a snippet from the snippets view and dropping into a source editor. The snippet is inserted at the drop location, and tabstops and cursor locations are honored. Snippet Preview Popup display information about a snippet: Snippet name, scope, and triggers - honors theme colors Snippet expansion contents - based on content-type settings Toolbar to perform additional actions - Navigate to source action (opens the contributing ruby file for modification of the snippet). Each Drawer contains the name and the count of snippets in the drawer Each snippet in the drawer displays the name and description of the snippet If the snipppet has tags, the tags are displayed in the snippet as a list of actionable buttons (buttons will filter based on the tag name) Each snippet has a toolbar with actions to perform on the snippet. Update Snippet Elements in Rubles to support Description, Category, Icon and Tags. The following attributes were added to a snippet element: description (String) - description of the snippet category (String) - category for the snippet icon path (String) - path to icon file tags (list of strings) - tags for the snippet. The way the Dashboard installs SDKs, it requires the SDK paths to be set in the preferences. In the case where the default SDK paths don't exist or invalid (ie, the user doesn't have permission), you will not be able to change the SDK paths to a desired location. To reproduce: 1. Have a valid Ti SDK setup 2. Export the all the preferences via 3. Edit the exported preference entry: with an invalid path. I used a path that the user does not have permissions, Save the file 4. Launch Ti Studio 5. Import the preferences via 6. Restart Ti Studio Expected: Ti SDK installation starts and prompts for a new location for installation Actual: Ti SDK installation starts and fails The same issue is exhibited with the Android SDK as well. The preferences for them are: The installation is triggered via the configuration in the Dashboard The installation should validate the SDK location to ensure it is valid (exists write permission), if it is not the user is prompted for a new location.

During the startup of Studio, it appears to hang for a few seconds while it is trying to load show dashboard. I think Dashboard needs to re-worked (either calling the services and caching the portal action results in the background) to improve the performance of its startup so it does not hang the Studio UI..

We need to start indexing the usage of translation keys in JS files so we can support F3 hyperlinks for navigating the relationship with their definitions in files. See. We need to start indexing the usage of translation keys in Alloy TSS files so we can support F3 hyperlinks for navigating the relationship with their definitions in files. See. Add a command with F3 binding to jump to the definition of translation keys in the file(s) in a Titanium Mobile project. This is simply a matter of defining a command with binding and handler, and then reusing some of the same implementation we have for the hyperlink detector from TISTUD-6692. Add a command with F3 binding to jump to of translation keys in other files in a Titanium Mobile project. This is simply a matter of defining a command with binding and handler, and then reusing some of the same implementation we have for the hyperlink detector.. Add data-binding attribute to Picker element.. We now can pass in auth for a given URL to our download manager (see TISTUD-6702). We need to break apart the utility method for installing modules to download and install separately and allow for passing in the auth in the download portion so for Mobware we can pass along auth to download the SDK zips.. Add hyperlink detector to jump from string keys in i18n files to usage in view files. Add hyperlink detector to jump from i18n translation keys in Alloy View XML files to their definition in files. Support content assist for curly braces syntax in bindings: we should provide CA for title subtitle after the period.. On clean installing the Appcelerator studio through installer, it creates additional folder Studio which contains an empty ""0D804B5"" folder. The actual installation of the product is in Studio"". Installing Studio dependencies fails when user has never run sudo before. Move Nukona out to it's own repo. We allow adding a node acs service underneath an existing project (definitely Ti Mobile projects, maybe any project nature?). When we do this we have a command handler which eventually call acs new. In 360 we need to override the handler and prompt user for org env and pass that down to acs new call.. Alloy: warnings relative to Custom TSS styles not being used should not be displayed. Load and store new property constant values from JSCA in JS' model for properties. Update CLI calls to old module create build python scripts. Look at parent screenshot 1, 'contentURL' property is not flagged as deprecated, but should be.. After encountering an error during the SDK configuration process I was unable to cancel the studio process a Mobile SDK"" Even after waiting 5 minutes it did not cancel and needed a Studio restart to resolve. I spoke to about the issue and the reason you need to cancel the studio process is because after the update error in the SDK tool occurs, the only option you have is to ""hide"". Previously that button would have been ""configure"". Attached the studio and diagnostic logs. Let me know if I need to clarify.. Creating an app from an alloy template is failing.. Tried all three preview links to install the update to and cannot get past the following error during the software update:. I took the studio updates restated my Studio. On restart I got the error prompt for 'An internal error occurred Computing SDK info'. Please refer the attached screen shot and log file for more clarification.. Module Project Packaging: Test steps: 1. Create an iOS Module Project. 2. Package module using all the three available option. Actual Result: No alert is displayed. Studio logs attached .Nothing displayed on console.. Steps Followed: 1. Create a Classic Mobile App with or without Cloud Services. Actual Result: NPE found in the log file. Please observe the attached log file for further clarification.. h5. To reproduce Right click on a project Profile as iOS device result App is installed on to device via iTunes and it is in state ""Waiting for profiler to connect"". h5. Expected result Message should appear and disappear shortly. For the controller code, content assist does not suggest any of the elements in the Alloy namespace, such as etc. See. No Mobile Web option is available for packaging under the global toolbar. Create a dark e4 theme (that is similar to our new ""Dashboard"" theme). Test Steps: a mobile project. the project on local server. the console view .screenshot attached. This ticket is to fix the issue long term timeframe) with our new skin and old theming system.. Pushed a possible fix via the method I describe above in a fragment in the repo.. Views revert back to white light grey background on redraw when user has editor theme applying to views. 1. Verify new eclipse theme ""Dashboard"" is being used in Preferences General Appearance. 2. Turn on option to apply editor theme to views in Preferences Studio Theme. 3. Choose a theme with a dark black background. Click OK. 4. Right click in a view like the Project Explorer. It will revert back to Dashboard theme's white light grey BG rather than keeping the black bg from editor. Result: 1. View takes on white BG color. Results: 1. View retains the same BG as the editor.. From Aditya: We also run into issues where the system path has been changed by the dev for some components but is not the same as the path that we check for our updates, which causes challenges when running updates. This pathing issue is both a Mac issue (where they edit their .bash profile and install paths VMware put node in opt instead of the default location and then the installer went into loop checking for node updates and installing) and Windows issue (where IT redirects installs from the user directory to some other path that they standardize on an NFS share for all end users) I think we need more details here. Are they installing multiple installations? Does this mean they're pointing at a specific install in the prefs but we're not honoring it? Are we just not picking up existing installs?. Platform Config Wizard: Not to resize the wizard width when expanding the Advanced Settings section. The preferences page for the JSLint validator used to have an open text field for setting options using JSON. It no longer does. Users can still set options using *jslint comment directives in their code.. If a user adds a new remote but doesn't perform an action that would actually fetch or hit the remote, git doesn't ""grab"" the list of branches at that remote. When a user adds a remote through studio we can pass a flag that forces an immediate fetch to help alleviate this.. Now that we can generate pull requests in Studio, it'd be nice to see the list of open PRs against a given repo and select them to merge the PR. We need to hook a menu extension to show the listing of open PRs and merge the PR when selected. (The user could optionally supply a commit message, but I think for a first cut we just send no commit message and they will likely generate a default). List open pull requests for git repo attached to github, selecting PR opens in browser. Every time we added a new mode for a platform, we generated new launch config types.

Code snippet is below: Screen shot is attached. Perform shallow clone and remove .git directory when importing samples from git repo. Update the Dashboard side to call the SDK-Info command with a ""windows"" key. Then, parse the result and display any info (like we do with the rest of the platforms). The Tizen section in Dashboard will look similar to what BlackBerry one shows.. Update the Dashboard to check for Windows Phone SDK and display corresponding message. We need to implement an SDKLocator subclass for windows. The class typically just looks up the SDK given the preference value and does some minor validation on the file folder structure, and then generates ""SDKEntity"" instances for each version of the SDK contained therein (which may just be one version here).. Add Launch shortcut for packaging a Windows Phone app. Add extension for Hook to the launch config type defined by TISTUD-4375. typically just define launch config type id we're tied to in extension and subclass of enablement expression strings; pointer to icon. Add launch config type image for packaging a Windows Phone app. Add extension for - refers to launch config type id and icon path.. Add extension for - refers to launch config type id and icon path.. Add extension for with an id, a handler. Implement the handler that will open a packaging wizard. The wizard will use the banner image defined in TISTUD-4363. The wizard will step user through the values options required to package an app.. Add launch delegate for packaging Windows Phone app. Add extension for Hook to the launch config type defined by TISTUD-4375. Typically need to subclass an standard titanium tab group base class, add a tab class. Tab class will define any Windows Phone specific arguments we need (currently unknown)..

Add 16x16 and 12x12 icons for Windows Phone platform. Define the pref page id, pointers to the 12x12 and 16x16 icons for modules table.. Add the preference page extension, add a preference page that includes a path to the windows phone SDK.. Add extension stub (just basic name ""Windows Phone"" id ""windows""? - check with platform for the id they'll be using sdk support check) (core). We have a handful of FTP and SFTP plugins. I'm not sure if they're advertised or used much by Titanium Studio users. We may want to break out an S FTP feature (and repo?) to move them to, build them separately and then include them under the Aptana Studio umbrella so they don't get installed in Titanium Studio by default, but only in Aptana Studio (like we did with We already have the S FTP library in it's own feature and build. It would likely be combined with the following:. Move BlackBerry preference page to blackberry UI plugin. Re-order the Test items under the main Run menu. We only show the user's personal repos in the listings. We should also look for the repos they have access to from their organizations.. h5. Problem Code completion is not automatically being displayed for Alloy TSS files. h5. Steps to reproduce 1. Create a new Alloy project 2.

Invoking content assist inside the braces throws an uncaught NPE and displays an error dialog.. A comment with security level 'Developers' was removed.. This involves moving the definitions and related classes for contributing the Publish Package - Adhoc action to ios' own plugins.. Refactor the Titanium module project wizard to have iOS plugin contribute its entry. Refactor the Titanium module project wizard to have ios plugin contribute its entry as shown in the screenshot.. Move all references of iOS from the mobile and core plugins to ios plugins. Once all the subtasks of refactoring the mobileweb code into its own plugin is completed, all the references of ios from the and has to be either removed or moved to ios ui core plugins. All the constants, resources and utility methods corresponding to ios should only be available in ios plugins.. Move Publish Package - iTunes action to iOS plugin. This involves moving the definitions and related classes for contributing the Publish Package - iTunes action to ios' own plugins.. Move Run iPhone Simulator action to iOS plugin(s). This involves moving the launch shortcut definitions and related classes for contributing the Run iPhone Simulator action to ios' own plugins.. Refactor the modules table section of to have ios plugin contribute its column. Have iOS plugin contribute to the preferences page. We should have a subnode for each platform under Preferences Titanium Studio Titanium and move the respective section from Titanium preference page there. The plugin will contribute the iOS preference page and handle its preference settings.. Move Run iPad Simulator action to ios plugin(s). This involves moving the launch shortcut and related classes for contributing the Run iPad Simulator action to ios' own plugins.. Refactor the Deployment Targets section of to have ios plugin contribute its entry. Refactor the Titanium project wizard to have ios plugin contribute its entry. Currently the Titanium project wizard defines all the checkboxes for deployment targets. We should have the ios plugin contribute the following attributes through the extension point from TISTUD-3066: 1. A display name (""iOS""); 2. A string for platform type (""ios"") that will be used by CLI and other necessary operations; 3. A mean to check if the requirement for platform support is met, if the Titanium SDK contains the platform, if the platform SDK is installed (not applicable to Mobile Web), and if the OS supports the platform (not applicable here either), so the project wizard could enable disable the checkbox as appropriate. It should return a status so we could display a warning or error message if needed. 4. Potentially a post-project creation hook to perform any iOS specific task needed (don't think we have any?). 5. An optional ""priority"" attribute to control the order of the platforms both here and in Currently we are sorting them in alphabetical order, but there might be a case in the future where we like to have the flexibility.. In XML, if you invoke CA after a ' ' we suggest attribute names, not values.. In HTML, if you type ',"", we auto-pop CA. That isn't the case for XML. We should make it do so (mainly for alloy, because normal XML doesn't actually have any proposals).. Once the user is able to set the path to the NodeJS source folder we need to be able to index it to get the details of the core modules under lib. These are straight JS files, so we can index them using our current mechanism. This should be treated like a 3rd-party library that can be attached to JS projects (much like an external JAR for JDT, possibly even just attaching ""Node"" to a project entirely which would be like attaching a JDK so it attaches the core modules form source and the $NODE PATH from the binary install).. NodeJS's core modules are defined in JS files under the lib subdir of the Node source package. This is not installed when the binary is. If the user has a source package on their system, we should allow them to point to it so we can look up those core modules. This would involve setting up a preference constant to use as the key to store the path, as well as the UI fields to set edit it in the Node preference page (which already exists and has a field for setting the path to the binary install).. We need to provide content assist for the list of property names for a given element in TSS files. is the token we'd suggest. We should take the string which is the key of the surrounding object, convert it to a fully qualified type name (see TISTUD-2783), then query the list of properties for that type. If the string is not the name of a type, but is a class or id, we need to query the class id index from the view files to resolve it to the type it is hanging off.. Provide content assist for property names in TSS. We'll need to begin indexing alloy's XML files to record the list of classes and ids used. This will then be used for TSS code assist. The involves adding a new for XML files. In the participant we may filter when we activate to only projects with alloy nature and files under The participant would parse the XMl file and traverse the AST to get the class id attribute info. When we record a class or id reference, we will likely also want to record the fully qualified type name of the element it is on. In this case we'd record that has a with an id value of ""myLabel"". The type is required to determine the property list in TSS content assist, as well as content assist in controller JS. The type namespace mapping is the same as in TISTUD-2783. Please note that the top-level widget (the child under the of would have an id of ""index"").. We need to offer up content assist for the keys of the JSON-like objects in TSS files. This ticket specifically addresses offerring up the list of classes and IDs found in the view files. The token is what we'd suggest. IDs use a prefix like in CSS, and classes use . The list of classes and ids is found by querying the indexed values from TISTUD-2798. should query all files. For other tss files we can limit the scope to just the associated view (same hierarchy and basename).. Once we have a proper parser we can use it to highlight syntax errors. This will involve creating a build participant that simply grabs the context's AST, asks for the SyntaxErrors and hooks them as problems to the BuildContext. See. We need to generate a TSS Parser. See the PEGJS grammar here: We'll need to generate an LALR grammar from that and then use beaver to generate a parser. We may be able to simply copy the and modify slightly to handle the changes that alloy introduces.. Hook up a special Content Assist processor for Alloy view XML files. Provide Content Assist for attribute names in Alloy view XML files. Alloy uses XML files to define views. We should provide content assist for the attributes of elements. For attribute CA we need to look up the properties for the given element's type in the JS index, as well as the events. To look up the type name, we take the element name as the type name and determine the namespace prefix. The default prefix is . If there is an attribute, use it's value as the namespace. Alloy will provide us with the exceptions to the rule for namespace mappings. - - - The list of attribute name proposals is: The list of properties of the type The list of events of the type. Each event name is transformed to be - ""click"" - ""onClick"" The common set of attributes: , and . It should be noted that the element may only have and attributes. The special element may have , , , and .. We explicitly make use of ""Window"" as the assumed global namespace for all JS files. This is only correct if the file is intended to be run inside a browser. With the use of TiMobile JS and in that environment, ""Global"" is the type we should be querying - not Window. We may need to alter indexing CA to determine the proper Global type to use based on the file's location, or project nature. We can safely assume that any inline JS in an HTML file will use Window. Beyond that we may just want to assume Window for all except Titanium Mobile or projects.. There are no entries for things like etc in our metadata. We need to add metadata for the new items added in ECMAScript 5. See and. When we lookup globals for Content Assist we explicitly look for members of Window. This is wrong, because we also need to look up members of it's supertype Global.. Webserver core plugin starting too slowly. Restrict the icon to standard app store guidelines.. A comment with security level 'Developers' was removed.. Add a right-click ""Alloy Add Widget menu item command that opens a dialog wizard similar to our Project template ""alloy list widgets"" command. When user selects a widget put the id that is listed in the returned json metadata for the widget into the Alloy in the dependencies object. For example if the user selected the ""Search For Books"" widget then the config should look like the following. , , ,. Once we have the deprecated flag for more JSCA members, we need to validate and warn about deprecated usage on both build and reconcile. This would leave the typical yellow ""squiggly"" underlining of the reference, as well as an entry in the Problems view.. HTML Files get !DOCTYPE declarations marked as warnings for unclosed tags. Add Update All Modules Functionality. We currently assume that a project root is the module root path. We need to query node npm for the list of module load paths ($NODE PATH) and try to resolve search against those, as well as handle searching up the hierarchy for node modules directories, and handle loading ""core"" modules from node itself. The following pseudo-code gives the algorithm: See: Additionally, it may make sense to index the paths specified in NODE PATH on startup.. Add Alloy Widget menu item to select import widgets that are available locally. Add a right-click menu ""Alloy Add Widget (dynamic list of widgets)"". Place a separator between the dialog item (from TISTUD-2280) and the actual list. ""alloy list widgets"" command.

Studio should handle the incompatible cache of ti info output. As part of installation process of Windows silent installer, we need to install Appc CLI stub and package in mode as well in the pre-requisites check.. Studio or higher versions should not support any BlackBerry functionality, even with previous Titanium SDKs.. Studio: Visual change in the Studio GUI in version. Cleanup downloading prerequisites with Mac Native installer. We have noticed a couple of problems with the Mac native installer and need to address them: 1. Files downloaded to temp folder should be cleaned up after installation completes 2. Download should use a buffer and flush mechanism (particularly to handle download of large files).. As per feedback from Neeraj the following issues will be handled through this ticket and Java should appear on next lines (as a column) and show the progress indicator next to each other. After installation, show a green check mark. 2. If all pre-reqs are already installed, then skip showing prereqs page.. Improve UI of Installer prerequisites plugin. Migrate the required JSON classes from socketio into jackson. Windows: Uninstaller - The uninstaller does not remove upgraded files from AppcStudio directory. Memory Leak with repeated debugging android app on device. In case CLI is not installed on the machine, then we would like to defer its installation until it is actually required. So, we should not prompt to install during the update wizard dialog either during the startup or even if the user check for updates. However if it is already installed on the machine, then we do need to check for its updates.. Defer CLI installation until the project is created. As every user doesn't use projects, there is no need to install CLI until the users are actually working with projects. So, if CLI is not installed, and the user attempts to create a project, then we should prompt and install acs CLI before we create the project.. Studio intermittently fails to retrieve the new version. The membership plans are associated with organization rather than with the user. So, if the user is part of multiple organizations, then we need to determine whether they have access to services by looking at the membership plans of all their organizations. If any of the membership plan is eligible for services, then we should allow them to install or update these services..

Issue After upgrading the XCode SDK to from and if the User launches the titanium app on iOS simulator, then the launch fails with the error 'invalid SDK version While launch the app, Studio does not validate SDK version stored in the launch configuration and it launches the app with the same old SDK version that is persisted in the launch configuration. h3. Workaround To workaround the issue, open the launch configuration and set the SDK to and then relaunch it.. Studio and does not show new iOS simulators in Run configurations. h3. Issue While debugging into the new issues reported by the user (TISTUD-5614), I have run into an issue with Studio, that it incorrectly use the obsolete cache to detect iOS simulators and SDKs. Due to this, Studio always displays simulator version such as even though or are available on the machine. h3. Workaround To workaround the issue, delete the files under and then, restart Studio. It should refresh the iOS info and show all the valid simulators.. After all the style elements are indexed, then the View file need to validate the missing style elements of 'class' and show any annotations if the class definitions are missing the corresponding style file or in the global file.. Create a Index reader to index all style elements defined in tss file. If a user defines style element such as 'class' for the a UI element in the View file, there is no way to let user define the style element block directly in the style file. Currently, they have to manually switch back to style file and then create the style data block using the 'class' element defined for the UI element. It would be easy for the user for a quick fix kind of mechanism, where they can press something similar to Cmd Ctrl + 1 on the class element value, and then create the style block in the tss file.. The View files in Alloy can contain ID types for each UI element. The types referenced in the View are probably defined in the corresponding Style file. Since Studio has knowledge of the Style code, it should allow to navigate the ID type to the Style code (similar to the F3 or method definition navigation in JDT Eclipse).. If a user defines style element such as 'id' for the a UI element in the View file, there is no way to let user define the style element block directly in the style file. Currently, they have to manually switch back to style file and then create the style data block using the Id defined for the UI element. It would be easy for the user for a quick fix kind of mechanism, where they can press something similar to Cmd Ctrl + 1 on the id value, and then create the style block in the tss file.. Alloy: Create a style section for 'id' from the View file. Studio fails to validate Android SDK after a new path is configured in preferences. Configure Android SDK - Android platform is not configured after fresh CLI install. BlackBerry: Fall back to default SDK path if the configuration file is not available. Add additional platform in the TiApp, for example to include Tizen. The platform shortcuts are not forever. If there is only one project in the explorer, then we need to unselect the project in the explorer to get the shortcuts related to Tizen. Otherwise, create a dummy project and change the selection between them to get the new platform launch shortcuts.. Android is still listed as the required SDK. The default user agents for Alloy and should refer to mobile platforms. The current default preferences for Alloy and project's user agent refers to the browsers such as Chrome, Firefox and IE. For Titanium and Appcelerator Studio, the default user agent should refer to mobile platforms (such as Android, iOS and others if required).. Studio should install npm packages locally into a folder accessible to the user without sudo permissions (to avoid problems described at TISTUD-5428) In order to accomplish this - 1) Currently we set global flag for any npm package installation. Mark all actions with npm packages without global to make them local installations. 2) The npm packages can not be in the .titanium or .npm folders under home directory. The folder name can not start with dot. 3) Remove the check for alias bin files in the usr local directory - as the local installation will not create symlink files in usr local directory. 4) Cleaning the cache sometimes requires sudo permissions - so we still need to prompt for password. However, use this password only for cleaning the cache.. Launch Profile Field Service app on iPad simulator and the launch throws an NPE error dialog : at. Investigate to generate reports from the performance tests. A few performance tests for studio3-core are already available and have been have been running now. However, if there's a regression, I think that's just silently logged in the DB right now.

Looking at the Studio output, the command sent includes the device ID. Using the command in terminal also would not allow a build, until the device ID was removed. h5. Steps to reproduce: 1) Install Xcode and Xcode 6 beta 7 in environment listed above 2) Set xcode-select to use 3) Create a project with SDK set in 4) Attempt to build for iOS any supported simulator h5. Result: Build begins but does not proceed h5. Expected Result: Build continues, completes without errors..

Description: Since the JSON payload within the CLI changed structure, Studio can no longer determine that the Android SDK is configured correctly. This may take a restart of studio or some time to clear the cached data in order to witness. The issue generally manifests itself first as a dialog show in the attachment This prevents studio users from being able to build with Android. h5. Steps to reproduce: 1) Use Titanium Studio 2) Install CLI using: ""sudo npm install -g 3) Install SDK (CLI currently has an issue, so use Studio) 4) Set CLI selected SDK to with: ""ti sdk select "" 5) Restart studio -additional note: you can use command ""ti info -o json -t android"" to see the difference in the structure of the payload regarding the Android SDK. h5. Result: You may see the ""computing SDK info"" error first. The Android SDK is no longer configured correctly and Studio will prompt the user to specify the Android SDK install location when trying to build for Android. Studio dashboard shows Android SDK as not configured. h5. Expected Result: Android SDK still working and user is able to build for Android.. Packaging App via Studio for Adhoc Distribution first will cause subsequent attempts to package for Appstore to fail. Studio will continue to send the command including ""dist-adhoc"". This results in inaccurate info presented in the console, as well as an incorrect toast saying the app store build was successful and complete. However, packaging for Appstore before Adhoc will succeed as expected and the project can be seen in Xcode organizer with Studio console output : Build type: production : Building for target: dist-appstore Packaging via CLI works as expected, and running a build command on an affected project works as expected, and seems to set the project correctly, so presumably the project could then be packaged for appstore in Studio as expected Test steps: 1. Create a project 2. Distribute - 3. Distribute - Apple iTunes Store Actual result: After step 3 At completion, Toast saying success and complete. Expected result: Building for target: dist-appstore The project should be placed in the archive section of the Xcode organizer. iOS: Packaging - Appstore distribution not possible via Studio if Adhoc Distribution is done first. CLI: Setting flag will render projects unable to launch simulator.. Android is now greyed. The dialog is when clicking on the Question Mark.. While investigating issues discovered with Xcode it became clear that what we were seeing as a bug where the SDK scripts were ignoring what was set as iOS SDK during Studio build for device or packaging was actually Studio displaying a list of simulator versions. This option should show either the actual list of SDK versions. The result of setting something other than an available SDK is that the setting is ignored. Since this is a list of emulators, this happens nearly every build (unless you choose a version where you have both simulator and SDK). This is not a regression, it occurs in many previous versions. Steps to reproduce: 1) Ensure xcode-select path and Studio preference are in sync. (refresh and restart Studio if required) 2) run terminal command ""xcodebuild -showsdks"" for later comparison 3) Create a new project in Studio and attempt to build for device. 4) Note pull-down options Result: Pull-down contains a list of simulators. Check the xcodebuild results which should be something like: Expected: A list of SDKs.. ",21,1242,7490

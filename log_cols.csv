Internally this would probably use a recipient list router to send to each individual sink. Module options for each individual sink would be combined to create the overall options for the composite sink module in a similar way to existing composite modules. This would allow construction of streams with less communication with the message bus for example as an alternative to using a named topic in the message bus. Using this in conjunction with sinks built using existing composite module functionality (as a combination of processors and a sink) would allow more sophisticated combinations to be constructed and deployed as a single module (with no message bus One particular application of this would be with tap and counter functionality. If multiple fields in a message need counted this currently needs to be done as separate streams tapping the original with the overhead of the tapped message being read from the message bus multiple times potentially on different nodes, this enhancement would allow all the counters to be combined to make a more cohesive composite counter module so that the tapped message would only need to be read once.",1350

It looks like this is the same issue as XD-3100 but the fix for that only fixed Rabbit as the message bus. This is easy to reproduce on a 2 container cluster using a Redis Message Bus: Create and deploy streams as follows: On container 1 send a message: Container 1 logs are then: and container 2: Ie the tapped message is duplicated (picked up by both tap module instances) Similarly for topics create and deploy these streams: On container 1 send a message: Container 1 logs are then: and container 2: Ie the topic message is picked up by each instance of the module in each stream. In this case I would expect each stream to pick up the message once ie I would get a single output for each stream test message 002 TOPIC CONSUMER 2 once (on either container) test message 002 TOPIC CONSUMER 1 once (on either container),988

In certain cases I want to use direct binding to remove communication with the message bus and deploy all modules to all containers with the aim of improving performance. Ive found that even when using direct binding, XD still communicates with Redis when it shouldnt need to. This could have an impact on performance. This is easily reproducible in our 2 container cluster as follows: Use the redis-cli monitor command to monitor Redis. Create and deploy a simple stream with direct binding: As expected both modules get deployed to both nodes. Testing shows messages sent to the http endpoint of one container always come out in the log for that container implying direct binding is in play as expected. However once the streams are deployed the Redis monitor starts showing a Redis queue being accessed from both XD conatiners: This shouldnt need to happen in direct binding.

The goal of the Story is to allow deployments to have a different pause time to give Kafka bus the extra time it needs but not affect the timeout for other stages of the tests.,465

Back story While streams are never ending, batch jobs have a true lifecycle with a beginning and and end. By having a job bootstrapped when it's not uting, it eats up precious resources. For example, if I have a job that creates connections to a database via a connection pool, the job module will hold those connections from the moment it's deployed to the moment it's undeployed, even if the job isn't being uted. A more efficient use of resources would be to have the job module provide just enough to receive the launch request and then bootstrap the job's context h2. Notes",885

This impacts balancing of the containers and modules in a cluster as messages should not be duplicated across modules if the same module is deployed twice to two containers in order to spread the load. We use taps quite heavily in our project mainly for analytics of the life feed in real time but due to issue we have discovered and described in this bug we are currently facing a limitation where heavily processing modules can not be load balanced across the cluster as they are causing duplication of the messages and therefore the same module deployed to two containers would still process the same message twice. To demonstrate the problem please see test case scenario set up below: h4. 1. Environment - Spring-XD version - Running two spring-xd containers and one spring-xd admin h4. 2. Set up Stream definition is as follows: stream create ""syslog-udp transform log"" stream deploy stream create transform + ""TAPPED ""' log"" stream deploy Please refer to the screen shots attached to see that after deploying those two streams we have: - streams successfully deployed ( ) - streams successfully deployed with count 2 to both containers ( ) - 5 queues created in Rabbit ( ) where two were created for the syslog-udp collector as a result of using - this is causing messages to be duplicated.

684,XD-2232,xd,thomasd,description,2014-10-12 11:59:54.828,"Often it is useful to have access to the median value for fields of a data stream since they are more robust with respect to outliers. The median is defined as the value of a dataset such that, when sorted, 50% of the data is smaller than the value and 50% of the data is larger then the value. Ordinarily this is difficult to calculate on a stream because it requires the collection and sorting of all data. The median of a data stream can be approximated with a technique called stochastic averaging. To approximate the median value of a data stream one could use the following approach: Given the current estimate of the median . If the next observed value in the stream is larger than , increase the current estimate by ( the learning rate). If it is smaller, decrease the estimate by . When is close to the median, it increases as often as it decreases, and therefore it stabilizes. The following example shows a primitive implementation of the above mentioned algorithm in groovy (to be placed under Stream definition: Post some JSON Output: After the median value should stabilize. This approach was taken from the book ""Real-time Analytics - Techniques to Analyze and Visualize Streaming Data"" P. 296 Byron Ellis Wiley Open points: - Support for resetting the median value - Better state management (Redis?) - Support median estimation for multiple fields - Make learning rate configurable from outside - Maybe add this as aggregation strategy?",1452

Instead of putting all libs in one directory and an XML in another, it could be a fat jar including some metadata file pointing to either an XML or to a JavaConfig configuration class inside the jar. Some more words why I think it's important to have something like that: Spring XD can be very well used in the enterprise, and at least for job modules it's likely to have some dependencies. So what do you have to do now to deploy such a module? Build a jar with your build process, then get it from your repository, unpack it and somehow find the relevant XML to copy it into the appropriate folder, then inspect the POM to find out what all the dependencies are, direct and transient, and get them from your repository to copy them into the appropriate folder. And of course, copy the jar. And when using Spring XD in distributed mode, you have to do it several times. With the approach mentioned above you just build your fat jar with your build process and distribute it to all your nodes, nothing complicated. And if you implement it like that it's easy to have a JavaConfig support that's almost the same.",1224

There is a limitation in the current implementation of now as only creates direct channels. The boolean aliasHint should probably be extended to some type of callback that creates a channel. The aliasHint was added to address the case of creating or looking up a queue backed channel or a direct channel.

1640,DNN-8141,dnn,george.alatrash,description,2015-12-22 00:45:21.859,"A moniker is a simple name provided for an objects that simplifies identifying specific object instances. This concept was first used in Microsoft Object Linking and Embedding (OLE), and the Component Object Model (COM). The DNN Services Framework was first introduced in DNN When creating web services with the Service Framework, it is common to require callers to provide the ModuleId and TabId as part of the web request header. This requirement complicates the programming model since service endpoints become tied to their specific location in a website. Modules are able to easily retrieve the ModuleId and TabId from the service framework as part of the initial module rendering. However, this mechanism is not available for remote callers, where the UI rendering is not directly controlled by DNN. In order to encapsulate this context data and to simplify the programming model for web services, we should introduce the concept of a moniker. The DNN service moniker will provide a mechanism for mapping a simple name to a specific module instance. This moniker can then be passed to a web service in place of the ModuleId, TabId or any other context data specific to a module. The moniker should be implemented as an additional system TabModule setting. By default, the moniker will be composed of the page name, the module definition friendly name and the TabModuleId separated by . When composing the default moniker, all spaces should be replaced with dashes. For example, if the Social Groups module was on the Community page with TabModuleId of 100, the default moniker would be The default moniker implementation provides a human friendly method to identify the page and module being addressed and also a unique element to differentiate between multiple modules on the same page. The core platform should expose a service endpoint that allows an application to query for monikers related to a specific module type that the current user has permissions to view. When calling service endpoints that need a specific module context, the moniker will be included as part of the service call. The service can then use the moniker to easily lookup any context for the module instance associated with the moniker. The purpose of this step is to help the back-end to create the DNN context for the web API request. Therefore, it is not tied to any authentication mechanism (like JWT, Basic, Forms, Injecting the moniker in the query part of the API request requires modifying all existing APIs that need to use this moniker but is not feasible and requires making changes to existing core (which we want to completely avoid). What we need is a non-invasive method. One way in which this can be implemented is by adding a new vendor specific header in the request as an alternate way to using the and that are in use today. Assume we are going to use for this purpose. An example of a full header would be: Before being able to use this feature, there is a need for an API that returns the various monikers associated with a specific module. Lets say in an EVOQ Engage site if we need to find all the monikers that use the discussions module, say discussions all tabs pages that have the discussions module in them), we will send an API request that returns all of these monikers associated with discussion modules placed on various pages. This call may return zero, one, or more monikers. There must be a consideration for user rights in every data returned from the API; no private data should be revealed to an un-authorized user.",3537

Hi Bing & Ash, The login cookie issue caused by and edge case and its not a real bug, the problem occur caused in that server, all child sites added into a site group but parent site not, so in this case: 1. When login from child site, cookies will save as local cookie and have expire date; 2. When login from parent site, cookies will save as session cookie. In this case, if you both open child site and parent site in different tabs in same browser, and when authentication timeout reached(in forms node, timeout default value is 60 minutes), membership will try to extend cookie, so that it will create duplicate cookie, you can verify with below steps: 1. Change set timeout to 3, so no need wait for a long time; 2. Open child site and login as host; 3. Open parent site in another tab in same browser, now it should also already login; 4. And wait for 5 minutes, then check cookies, you will see 2 cookies. so we need notice that when create site groups, we need avoid that cookie name may shares with sites which not in site group, and IMO no need code fix for this problem, the workaround is just close browser and open again. Thanks, Ben Zhong Senior Developer And generally when this happening, in Cookies list, you will see 2 items, same cookies name, but different values.",1590

As part of this work jquery-migrate was no longer registered for a default anonymous page viewer as it was not needed - however post release it became apparent that some skin and module developers were relying on jquery-migrate being registered (rather than registering it within their skin module). Whilst this is easily fixed by adding the relevant registration (or using the jquery skin object), we decided to add a registration for jquery-migrate to help with sites running skins modules that relied on this dependency existing users would not need to get updated versions of their components).

Leveraging the standard user experience, we will create a new Development module category in the Add Module menu in the Control Panel. A new Module Creator module will be available in this category. This module is only relevant to Host users. The should make the option very discoverable and accessible for developers ( ie. they do not have to navigate the various administrative menus ). This Module Creator module can be added to any page just like a normal DotNetNuke module. It exposes a number of basic options which a developer will need to provide in order to create a custom module: Owner Name: DotNetNuke requires a unique top level namespace to ensure uniqueness. The owner name could be an organization name, brand name, developers name, The system will save the value provided as a Host Setting so that it can be used as a default for any modules created in the future. Module Name: A short name to identify the purpose of the module Description: Optional. A description of the module Language: C or VB. The default is C . Changing the selection reloads the list of Templates. Template: A list of templates loaded dynamically based on the Language selected. It will only display templates of type Module. There are 3 different dynamic module models which can be utilized based on preference Inline Script, User Control, and Razor. The default will be Module User Control. When a user selects a template, it will load and display an associated file ( if one exists ). The file can contain a description of the template files, but it can also include code samples which could be cut and pasted into the module control to add additional functionality. Control Name: Modules can contain multiple controls. This option allows the user to specify the name of the file created. The default will be View When the developer presses the Create Module button it will register the module in the database, create a module category for the Owner and associate it to the module, and update the ModuleDefID of the module instance with the ModuleDefID of the newly registered module. The end result is that the Module Creator module will be replaced on the page with the new module created. At this point the module is fully usable within the environment and the developer can browse to the page where it is located using the standard website navigation.",2650

I have now verified this issue on two different computers, both Windows 7 x64. I followed all of instructions in email, attached my theme, reset defaults on annotations and set defaults on theme and as you can see from the attached the issue remains. In order to fix this I need to go to preferences aptana studio themes and press ""reset defaults"" Every time I start I need to go do that reset defaults. I don't think it's the theme: something buggy happens when Aptana initializes that changes something in my settings. Having to go through settings to undo it is lame, and it has to be a change that happened with the latest upgrade. Please get someone to fix :) After latest upgrade, highlighted text color (PyDev editor) is opaque and changing theme colors does not work reliably. All themes show behavior like the attached screenshot: the highlighted text foreground and background are the same color. Changing selected foreground colors does not work as expected: selecting a dark-colored selection background results in a light-colored background. Selecting the theme override for seems to fix the issue for the current session, but when I shut down Aptana and restart the highlight is broken again, even though the little 'B' icon next to is still selected. I need to click it off and back on again to fix the highlight, which again only works until I restart. I've been using Aptana without issues for at least 6 months prior to this issue, and have not touched color settings in months. The latest update seems to have broken theme handling. MOTE UPDATES: See attached. If you look closely, I selected a very dark gray(almost back) color for the line highlight and Aptana is using a bright gray. Any color I choose for the line highlight is ignored, and Aptana chooses a much brighter color. Aptana is just ignoring my setting for selected text altogether. MORE UPDATES: I have had two instances today where I started Aptana, went in and changed so that I could see highlighted text (the broken bug is 100% repeatable). After switching to another window and switching back the highlight was broken again, requiring me to change the setting again. This is profoundly irritating. I hope whatever change broke color handling was awesome enough to cause this much pain.",2358

(Seems to be because of changes to default settings?) We could put the settings into jslint comments to make it work how we want it to, but that would require adding the settings to the 300+ JavaScript files that we have on our site. That is unacceptable. We need a place to be able to specify JSLint's settings on a global level. We use JSLint on ""reconcile"" mode, and seeing all of the errors (for things like supposedly ""messy"" whitespace, using multiple 'var' statements, etc) makes the tool downright useless for the actual errors that we need it to catch. h3. Actual Result (See above) h3. Suggested solution Remove the filter box from the validator main page and have the pencil icon open up a new window (similar to how formatting works). See screenshots. For JSLint (and all validators), we would keep a filter text box, as well as have another text box where a user can specify whatever JSLint commands they'd like to issue I'm assuming this would be in the form of a string of options that would then be injected into the comments of a file before parsing.",1168

2691,APSTUD-4840,apstud,neill,description,2012-05-21 06:16:55.000,"This is a clone of bug APSTUD 4661 as I made the following comment on it, but I guess because that bug was deemed fixed, the comment went unnoticed. I've included the previous bug description after the new additional problem description. The previous bug was not correctly fixed and the following describes the remaining, rather peculiar, issue. I've upgraded to Aptana Studio 3, build: and have tested the following on Mageia and Ubuntu If I turn off the Refresh checkbox, save and view it again it remains off. If I close down Aptana and restart it, the checkbox remains off. If I close Aptana, log out, log back in again, and restart Aptana and view it, it remains off. The same is true if I don't close Aptana before logging out. However, if I reboot my machine, log in and then restart Aptana, it is now back on again. In other words, the setting doesn't seem to survive a reboot. I would guess this hints that the value is somehow being kept in memory and linux is reassigning that portion of memory to Aptana during the restarts of Aptana and even over a log out and log in again. Don't know if that is possible, but I can't imagine why it's misbehaving only on a reboot otherwise. Steps to reproduce: a) log in to either Mageia or Ubuntu or possibly other variants of linux or other OSes(haven't tested on those) b) start up Aptana and turn OFF the Refresh button c) REBOOT your machine d) log in again and start up Aptana, and view the value. All things going well it's back on again. Who'd have thought one checkbox could be so mysterious!! The original bug description was I've just upgraded to the latest aptana release and immediately hitting cpu usage issues with the CPU jumping to 90%ish every few seconds corresponding to a refresh of the workspace every few seconds. So I guess on my system Aptana the option 'Refresh using Native hooks or polling' is polling rather than hooks as it happens regardless of whether or not I'm doing anything. I've traced it down to the 'Refresh using Native Hooks or Polling' which is under the Workspace menu. If I turn it off, the system quietens down and all is fine. However, on a restart, this 'option' has re options saved (or perhaps isn't getting saved to the file?) So the bug I'm reporting here is the preference can't be set beyond a restart and, of course, like all preferences it should be. A second bug I guess is quite why the refresh of the workspace uses so much CPU - my system has 8000 files on a fairly old machine so I'm guessing it's hitting limits on my machine (results will of course vary on other machines). I've commented on that before (in the forums) and it was all fine in version 3 until now. I'll repeat my guess that there is a very inefficient method involved in the refresh of the workspace that still hasn't been resolved. Anyway - hopefully to replicate Type Workspace in to the preferences and select Workspaces at the bottom to get the ""Refresh "" option. Unselect it. Restart the studio, go back to that preference and you'll (hopefully) see it selected again. I've attached two images - the first when I deselected the option. The second when I restarted showing the option has been selected again.",3188

So I guess on my system Aptana the option 'Refresh using Native hooks or polling' is polling rather than hooks as it happens regardless of whether or not I'm doing anything. I've traced it down to the 'Refresh using Native Hooks or Polling' which is under the Workspace menu. If I turn it off, the system quietens down and all is fine. However, on a restart, this 'option' has re options saved (or perhaps isn't getting saved to the file?) So the bug I'm reporting here is the preference can't be set beyond a restart and, of course, like all preferences it should be. A second bug I guess is quite why the refresh of the workspace uses so much CPU - my system has 8000 files on a fairly old machine so I'm guessing it's hitting limits on my machine (results will of course vary on other machines). I've commented on that before (in the forums) and it was all fine in version 3 until now. I'll repeat my guess that there is a very inefficient method involved in the refresh of the workspace that still hasn't been resolved. Anyway - hopefully to replicate Type Workspace in to the preferences and select Workspaces at the bottom to get the ""Refresh "" option. Unselect it. Restart the studio, go back to that preference and you'll (hopefully) see it selected again. I've attached two images - the first when I deselected the option. The second when I restarted showing the option has been selected again.",1604

2918,APSTUD-4113,apstud,ingo,description,2012-01-30 10:48:56,"From Handling functions is a bit different than any other type in the type system. Functions derive from ""Object"". As a result, new properties can be added to function instances. Functions also my be invoked, taking a possibly empty list of arguments and possibly returning a value. The type system keeps track of these two bits of information in separate locations. If properties are added to the Function, then a new sub-type of Function is created. However, parameters and return values are captured on the property that references the function type. This makes for some difficulties in the current inferencing engine. As we infer types for nodes in an AST, we need to be able to determine return types of invoked functions. We do this using a function signature: We are able to use the return type list for invocations. So, when we ask for the type of a property, we always return a string value. When asking for the type of a function property specifically, we need to return a function signature. This notion was confused and the Function aspect of the signature was used as the type name as well. This causes all sorts of problems and needs to be removed. For example, the jQuery library is defined by an sdocml file. Its constructors return a jQuery type; however, internally, we say that the jQuery global method is of type ""Function"". So, any time we see the type ""jQuery"", we have to map it to ""Function"". By removing the notion of ""Function wrapper refactor existing classes to use unity methods",1507
2919,APSTUD-4113,apstud,klindsey,description,2012-05-17 13:38:37,"refactor out utility classes to determine if a type is a function ""typeName"" represents the name of the Function subtype. It is wrapped in ""Function aspect of the signature was used as the type name as well. We really only need Using ""Function"" makes it difficult to look up ""typeName"" since you have no idea when to use just ""typeName"" versus ""Function"". For example, the jQuery library is defined by an sdocml file. Its constructors return a jQuery type; however, internally, we say that the jQuery global method is of type ""Function"". So, any time we see the type ""jQuery"", we have to map it to ""Function"". By removing the notion of ""Function"" notation. If a function is being accessed like an object, then treating the function like any other object will be just fine. For example, in the following: If you place the cursor at ' ' and ask for content assist, then inferencing will look up abc's type and find that it is At this point, inferencing simply queries the index for ""abc"" and then displays all properties on that type in the proposal list. However, if you change the code slightly: Things get a little more challenging. is actually a ""get-property"" node with ""abc()"" on its left-hand side. This is further defined as an invoke node with an identifier node as a child. The child of an invoke node can be an arbitrary expression, so we can't rely on that child always being an identifier. This means that we have to infer the type of the child of the invoke node. In this case, we get ""abc"" which is type ""abc"". We're now at the line between types and properties. We access the ""abc"" type, but for purposes of invocation, we need the ""abc"" property, off of Window in this case, because that property tells us that it is a function that returns ""String"". It's type information doesn't tell us this. And this is were the challenge lies. The invocation node actually needs to infer what is called a Reference. A Reference is a tuple composed of an object and a property name. Inferencing has been setup to return type info as strings, so the fact that we need a Reference here breaks our inferencing code around function invocation. Remember that the child of JSInvokeNode has to be inferred. This could be an arbitrarily complex subtree that touches most of the current cases handled by the inferencing engine. The engine uses strings which implies we would have to build a parallel system to return a Reference instead. That would be a horrible maintenance pain in the neck. So, this is why inferencing uses function signatures. These can be returned as strings and it preserves the return type info of the function, all without having to use References and a parallel system for those. So, in theory, we should be able to simply remove ""Function< "" from the type name and then anywhere in inferencing where we need to differentiate between a function or a property, we can look up the ancestor chain of the type to determine if it derives from Function. Ideally, this could be cached in some way so we don't have to hit the index tons of times during inferencing. Even though we have a utility method to get a full ancestor chain of a type, this requires one read per ancestor type. For performance reasons, we should always minimize reads writes to the index if possible.",3284

The endpoints need to be canonical since the operator would want to rebootstrap each of these entities (isolators) individually (there is no dependency between them. This implies that if we have a single end point something will have route the requests to right isolator (probably the which will automatically happen if at the `libprocess` level if we separate end points for each isolator.,447

Status Quo Currently resources allocated to frameworks in a role with quota (aka quota'ed role) beyond quota guarantee are marked non-revocable. This impacts our flexibility for revoking them if we decide so in the future. h4. Proposal Once quota guarantee is satisfied we must not necessarily further allocate resources as non-revocable. Instead we can mark all offers resources beyond guarantee as revocable. When in the future evolves frameworks will get additional information about ""revocability"" of the resource allocation slack) h4. Caveats Though it seems like a simple change, it has several implications. h6. Fairness Currently the hierarchical allocator considers revocable resources as regular resources when doing fairness calculations. This may prevent frameworks getting non-revocable resources as part of their role's quota guarantee if they accept some revocable resources as well. Consider the following scenario. A single framework in a role with quota set to CPUs is allocated CPUs as non-revocable resources as part of its quota and additionally revocable CPUs. Now a task using non-revocable CPUs finishes and its resources are returned. Total allocation for the role is non-revocable + revocable. However, the role may not be offered additional non-revocable since its total allocation satisfies quota. h6. Resource math If we allocate non-revocable resources as revocable, we should make sure we do accounting right: either we should update total agent resources and mark them as revocable as well, or bookkeep resources as non-revocable and convert them to revocable when necessary. h6. Coarse-grained nature of allocation The hierarchical allocator performs allocation, meaning it always allocates the entire remaining agent resources to a single framework. This may lead to some resources as non-revocable beyond quota guarantee. h6. Quotas smaller than fair share If a quota set for a role is smaller than its fair share, it may reduce the amount of resources offered to this role, if frameworks in it do not accept revocable resources. This is probably the most important consequence of the proposed change. Operators may set quota to get guarantees, but may observe a decrease in amount of resources a role gets, which is not intuitive.",2270

In mesos we need to give the operator the ability to fix the 16-bit major handle used in an agent (the minor handle will be allocated by the agent. See MESOS-4345). Fixing the parent handle on the agent allows operators to install default firewall rules using the parent handle to enforce a default policy (say DENY ALL) for all container traffic till the container is allocated a minor handle. A simple way to achieve this requirement is to pass the major handle as a flag to the agent at startup.,652

If the previous instance of the tries to send a Call , with the same previous set, it would be still accepted by the master leading to erroneously killing a task. This is possible because we do not have a way currently of distinguishing connections. It used to work in the previous driver implementation due to the master also performing a check to verify if they matched and only then allowing the call. Following the design process, we will implemented ""stream IDs"" for Mesos HTTP schedulers; each ID will be associated with a single subscription connection, and the scheduler must include it as a header in all non-subscribe calls sent to the master.",902

This guards Systemd from migrating the pids that are descendants of the process launched by a Systemd unit. In order for this strategy to work, the flag must be supported by the Systemd version. Support for this was introduced in Systemd v218; however, it has also been backported to v208 for RHEL7 and CentOS7 with the package . It is highly recommended to upgrade to this package if running those operating systems. Once the flag has been set, the cgroups that are manually manipulated by the agent will no longer be migrated . This still leaves the problem of tasks being migrated after the agent has stopped running (voluntarily or not). In order to deal with the problem we propose the following solution: If an agent is running on a Systemd initialized machine, then the agent will create a Systemd slice with a life-time that is independent of the agent and . The linux launcher (used when cgroups isolators are enabled) will then assign the cgroup name for any utor that is launched to this separate slice. The consequence of this is that when the agent unit is terminated, the separate slice will continue to delegate the cgroups preventing Systemd from migrating the pids. A side benefit of this is that we can maintain the flag on the agent and terminate all agent specific services such as the without terminating the tasks. This provides for a nice clean-up. This solution will still require that the agent unit be launched with the flag such that there is no race during the transition of the pids from the agent to the separate slice. The agent will be responsible for verifying the slice is still available upon recovery, and warning the operator if it notices that the tasks it is recovering are no longer associated with this separate slice, as this can cause loss of isolation of existing tasks.",1961

The drawback of this approach is that it potentially pollutes the host mount table which requires cleanup logics. For instance, in the test, we create a test rootfs by copying the host files. We need to do a self bind mount so that we can pivot root on it.

NOTE: Registry variable can be rather big for production clusters (see MESOS-2075). While it should be fine for MVP to add quota information to registry, we should consider storing Quota separately, as this does not need to be in sync with slaves update. However, currently adding more variable is not supported by the registrar. While the Agents are reregistering (note they may fail to do so), the information about what part of the quota is allocated is only partially available to the Master. In other words, the state of the quota allocation is reconstructed as Agents reregister. During this period, some roles may be under quota from the perspective of the newly elected Master. The same problem exists on the allocator side: it may think the cluster is under quota and may eagerly try to satisfy quotas before enough Agents reregister, which may result in resources being allocated to frameworks beyond their quota. To address this issue and also to avoid panicking and generating under quota alerts, the Master should give a certain amount of time for the majority 80%) of the Agents to reregister before reporting any quota status and notifying the allocator about granted quotas.",1492

For example, with the interface : With a default This allows to create typed tests which look as following: The test will be applied to each of types in the template parameters of . This allows to test different implementation of an interface. In our code, it tests default and a module which uses the same default The class needs a little explanation, it is a wrapper around which allows the tests to encode information about the requested module in the type itself instead of passing a string to the factory method. The wrapper around create, the real important method looks as follows: Problem Consider the following implementation of : As it can be seen, this implementation cannot be used as a default implementation since its create API does not match the one of : has a different signature for both types. It is still a common situation to require initialization parameters for objects, however this constraint (keeping both interfaces alike) forces default of modularized components to have default constructors, therefore the tests are forcing the design of the interfaces. which are supposed to be used as modules only, non default are allowed to have constructor parameters, since the actual signature of their factory method is, this factory method's function is to decode the parameters and call the appropriate constructor: where parameters is just an array of key-value string pairs whose interpretation is left to the specific module. Sadly, this call is wrapped by which only allows module parameters to be passed from the command line and does not offer a programmatic way to feed construction parameters to modules. Ugly Workaround With the requirement of a default constructor and parameters devoid factory function, a common pattern (see ) has been introduced to feed construction parameters into default this leads to adding an call to the public interface, which will have become: will thus look as follows: Look that this method now has to be implemented by all descendants of , even if there's a which takes is return value for from a DB, it will need to support as an initialization parameter.

And some test driven development: Alternatively, the caller can ask to have conflated with : However, will be ignored by default: An analysis of existing usage shows that in almost all cases, the caller only cares ; in fact, the actual exit code is read only once, and even then, in a test case.

There are two approaches: 1) Pass in the allocated resources for each utor through the interface. 2) Let containerizer return total resources allocated for each container when 'usages()' are invoked. I would suggest to take route (1) for several reasons: 1) Eventually, we'll need to pass in slave's total resources to the resource estimator (so that RE can calculate allocation slack). There is no way that we can get that from containerizer. The slave's total resources keep changing due to dynamic reservation. So we cannot pass in the slave total resources during 2) The current implementation of usages() might skip some containers if it fails to get statistics for that container (not an error). This will cause in-complete information to the RE. 3) We may want to calculate 'unallocated total - allocated' so that we can send allocation slack as well.

Would be more efficient to do a .reserve() on the result string, and then fill the result buffer). The ignores that you can have an error partially through reading a file doesn't find the error or propagate it up. The fopen() variant reads one newline separated line at a time. This could produce interesting unexpected reading in the context of a binary file. It also causes glibc to insert null bytes at the end of the buffer it reads (excess computation). result isn't pre-allocated to be the right length, meaning that most of the continually read lines will result in realloc() and a lot of memory copies which will be inefficient on large files.",962

3713,MESOS-2735,mesos,benjaminhindman,Comment,2015-05-20 00:42:56.224,"There are definitely differences in message queue behavior, one of which is significantly safer than the other. There are two safety concerns that I can think of, one of which has addressed here but I'll repeat to be sure I properly understood. (1) Someone might write a that isn't asynchronous, causing the slave to ""block"" while the resource estimator estimates. (2) The might cause a denial of service attack on the slave. I understand the concern with (1) but I'm not too anxious about it. Why? It should be trivial to make a wrapper module which forces people to implement the to be asynchronous, either using `async` like you suggested or implementing a version of which wraps an actor (libprocess process). We'll only need to do this once and then other implementations can leverage this stuff. On the other hand, I don't like the behavior of push because of (2). Fundamentally, if the slave can't keep up with the rate at which the is pushing then we could create a denial of service issue with the slave, it takes a long time to process messages because it's queue is full of just messages. I'm more anxious about (2) than (1) because it's harder to find bugs in (2) than with (1) since once you fix (1) it stays fixed forever but any time you updated the algorithm you impact the potential to cause (2). Now, I acknowledge that implementing this as a pull versus push will make the implementation in the slightly more complicated, but not really. In particular, it should be trivial to always use a `Queue` to achieve the push semantics in any implementation, while still providing the pull semantics externally. Make sense? Finally, one of the advantages of the pull model is that it's easier to reason about because we don't have ""anonymous"" lambdas that cause ution in some other random place in the code you can easily see in the slave where the future that gets returned from gets handled). In addition, the remains ""functional"" in the sense that it just has to return some value (or a future) from it's functions versus invoking some callback that causes something to get run some other place (and in fact, may also block, so isn't it safer for the to invoke the callback in it's own `async`?). The invocation of the followed by the is a nice pattern that let's us compose with other things as well, which is harder to do with the lambda style callbacks and why we've avoided it where we've been able (in fact, I'm curious which place in the code are you imitating here?).",2488

This hogs the cluster and gives users a inconsistent view of the cluster state. Going to the slave, the task is finished. Going to the master, the task is still in a non-terminal state. When the scheduler reattaches or the failover timeout expires, the tasks finishes correctly. The current workflow of this scheduler has a long fail-over timeout, but may on the other hand never reattach. Here is a test framework we have been able to reproduce the issue with: It launches many short-lived tasks (1 second sleep) and when killing the framework instance, the master reports the tasks as running even after several minutes: When clicking on one of the slaves where, for example, task 49 runs; the slave knows that it completed: Here is the log of a mesos-local instance where I reproduced it: (Here task 10 to 19 are stuck in running state). There is a lot of output, so here is a filtered log for task 10: The problem turn out to be an issue with the ack-cycle of status updates: If the framework disconnects (with a failover timeout set), the status update manage on the slaves will keep trying to send the front of status update stream to the master (which in turn forwards it to the framework). If the first status update after the disconnect is terminal, things work out fine; the master pick the terminal state up, removes the task and release the resources. If, on the other hand, one non-terminal status is in the stream. The master will never know that the task finished (or failed) before the framework reconnects. During a discussion on the dev mailing list ( we enumerated a couple of options to solve this problem. First off, having two ack-cycles: one between masters and slaves and one between masters and frameworks, would be ideal. We would be able to replay the statuses in order while keeping the master state current. However, this requires us to persist the master state in a replicated storage. As a first pass, we can make sure that the tasks caught in a running state doesn't hog the cluster when completed and the framework being disconnected. Here is a to work out of: A new (optional) field have been added to the internal status update message: Which makes it possible for the status update manager to set the field, if the latest status was terminal: I added a test which should high-light the issue as well: I would love some input on the approach before moving on.

There are at least two possible approaches to solving this issue: 1. Introduce a health check from Slave to Master so they have a consistent view of a network partition. We may still see this issue should a one-way connection error occur. 2. Be less aggressive about marking tasks and Slaves as lost. Wait until the Slave reappears and reconcile then. We'd still need to mark Slaves and tasks as potentially lost (zombie state) but maybe the Scheduler can make a more intelligent decision.",903

Refresh tokens are issued to the client by the authorization server and are used to obtain a new access token when the current access token becomes invalid or expires, or to obtain additional access tokens with identical or narrower scope (access tokens may have a shorter lifetime and fewer permissions than authorized by the resource owner). Issuing a refresh token is optional at the discretion of the authorization server. If the authorization server issues a refresh token, it is included when issuing an access token step (D) in Figure 1). More detail about this in: Successful Response The authorization server issues an access token and optional refresh token, and constructs the response by adding the following parameters to the entity-body of the HTTP response with a 200 (OK) status code: access token REQUIRED. The access token issued by the authorization server. token type REQUIRED. The type of the token issued as described in Section Value is case insensitive. expires in RECOMMENDED. The lifetime in seconds of the access token. For example, the value ""3600"" denotes that the access token will expire in one hour from the time the response was generated. If omitted, the authorization server SHOULD provide the expiration time via other means or document the default value. refresh token OPTIONAL. The refresh token, which can be used to obtain new access tokens using the same authorization grant as described in Section 6. scope OPTIONAL, if identical to the scope requested by the client; otherwise, REQUIRED. The scope of the access token as described by Section Current implementation of OAuth2 is expecting always to get refresh token so if the OAuth2 server during a refresh token operation sends only the access token Mule is failing to get the refresh token with the following exception: h5. Proposed Solution As described in the spec if there is a refresh token issued by the OAuth2 server it should be used for getting new access tokens if not it should fail when the current access token is no longer valid (after a 401 403 status code and before retrying the request) and a exception of type should be thrown.

After restarting an application that uses the Box Connector, the first time a box request is made with a preexisting Box connection, that has an expired access token in its OAuthState, a refresh token process is triggered that does not attempt to save the refresh and access token obtained from box in the connector's ObjectStore. The Box connector postAuthorize method invokes one of the connector's processors in order to retrieve the id of the user after the OAuth2 dance for identification purposes. That request within the postAuthorize triggers the first refresh token process for the connector on its first use after restart. The way to reproduce the issue would be: - Run a mule application on mule with the Box Connector and a persistent Objectstore for it - Do the OAuth dance with a Box user using the authorize - Wait until the Box access token expires or modify it in the OAuthState saved in the Objectstore to make it invalid - Restart the mule application and attempt to run a Box like twice.

4474,NEXUS-9088,nexus,dsauble,Comment,2015-08-19 14:51:08.931,"The problem is with settings panels that handle their own load state. Most of the time, load and submit are specified via the api config option: This results in the `submitted` and `loaded` events being called, respectively. The function takes advantage of the config option to reset a forms dirty state when `setValues` is called. We set the values to the return value from `getValues`. However, `getValues` omits fields with an undefined value (for example, checkboxes that arent checked). `setValues` only resets the dirty state of fields for which it has a value. Because unchecked checkboxes arent passed to it, they stay dirty, and the save discard buttons remain enabled. There are a couple approaches we can use to fix this: 1) Add 'off'` to each affected checkbox ( 2) Override the `getValues` method of the `SettingsForm` component to return values for all fields, not just fields with a defined value. 3) Figure out how to emulate the normal behavior of the component (where both `submit` and `load` are handled by the framework) These solutions are ordered by complexity. 1 is simplest. 3 is hardest.

Hopefully this gives enough of a lead to investigate without me permuting through a bunch more items. If this seems familiar, it may be because of NEXUS-8517. I am creating a seperate ticket for several reasons. First, there was some skepticism if that ticket is about granting proper permissions (like a race condition to edit before the repo is editable). This is with default created repos so there shouldn't be such a race to my knowledge. Second, totally different set of steps. You'll note there actually isn't any actions besides view changes being done. Third, this seems to have nothing to do with timing (NEXUS-8517 ""goes away"" if you wait a very small amount of time).

After finding the info I needed, I returned to Tasks but my create button was greyed I was able to repro this reliably by filtering on a second level (Tasks) returning to a base level (not even filtering) and then returning. Steps below. I went to see if this was an issue in m3 but as far as I can tell there are no second level filters in m3, this is a new concept to Dizzam. This also does not affect NX2 (same reason but more basic). Borderline minor as the workaround is to browser. I do not believe this is related to where I found it but linking in case wrong and for completeness. Steps: 1) Login to NX3 (Dizzam) as admin 2) Click Tasks (admin section, under System) 3) Click Create 4) Filter by something (like ""whatever"") 5) Click Repositories (left nav item under Repository) 6) Click Tasks again.

The code that runs the new pass-through queries against the NuGet proxy will automatically page through all results that match the query rather than stop at the first page. This means that if you get the ""Packages"" feed using curl with no query parameters it will attempt to page through the entire NuGet proxy feed and not come back for several minutes. This could explain the longer query times occasionally observed in the field, because we'll be fetching all matching entries rather than stopping at the first page of results. However, the next time the query is run it would be faster because we've pre-fetched all subsequent pages. If possible we should take exactly what's returned from the NuGet upstream feed and not follow ""next page"" references. This should just be a matter of tweaking the feed scraper.",869

We'd not only store them for the class definition but also for every instance! Now that we store them in an unordered map and generate them on-demand they're only cached once per class. But it'd be a good improvement to move to something like an LRU cache to evict older constants out of the in-memory cache if we ever need to free some memory. It'd be good to have more details on just how much memory these are taking up and what the speed perf overhead of always generating them on-demand would be (or if that'd even be feasible whether the constants would be considered equal when regenerated).,750

Depending on your luck, you will either get no error or a file rename error. pngcrush returns 0 if crushing fails, which is probably a bug with pngcrush (or at least the one shipped with Xcode 7). The rename error happens because pngcrush take the input file and writes the crushed png to another file and the iOS build needs to rename it back to the correct filename. If the temporary crushed png image was never generated, then there's nothing to rename and then it blows up. It's worth noting that in Titanium SDK and older, the iOS build called . This is a perl script that converts plists into binary format and crushes pngs. The problem with this script is if pngcrush fails, it aborts the entire script and returns 0. This is bad.

5691,TIMOB-18956,timob,patakijv,description,2015-05-26 21:42:06,"The documentation confirms that this is missing from the various places where in Android you could detect orientation change. property never reports the ""reverse"" orientations* and Android itself does report the reverse orientation changes, Titanium is just not surfacing this level of reporting. This deficiency prevents being able to detect precisely to which orientation has the device been rotated to with respect to a view, such as a camera view needed for barcode scanning. When the device has rotated but the view (and the object which is the subject of the scanning) has not rotated, you must be able to determine what the relative rotation is without the possibility of being 180 degrees off. Let me try to illustrate how this becomes a problem with some ASCII art and the scenario being a barcode scanning camera view in a module where the app must report to the module the orientation change. This is just an example of 1 use case where this deficiency can be seen as a problem. Let's say this is your device in portrait orientation: ABCD are the corners of the hardware, abcd are the corners of the camera view. Let's say the camera sensor is mounted such that the top-left corner of the picture is nearest to the A corner, the top-right corner of the picture is nearest to the B corner, etc. In this case, the rotation difference between the camera sensor and the camera view is 0 degrees, so the pixel at the top-left corner of the picture can go near the 'a' corner of the view, the pixel at the top-right corner of the picture can go near the 'b' corner of the view, etc. If the activity supports orientation, then this is how your screen will look like if you rotate your device 90 degrees The important thing to realize is that the camera sensor rotated with the hardware but the view didn't, and neither did the object you are pointing the camera at. So the top-left pixel is still near the A corner as far as the camera sensor is concerned, but now that pixel needs to go to the 'c' corner of the view, otherwise from your (the user's) perspective the camera feed will look like it's rotated 90 degrees clockwise (because the object in front of the camera didn't rotate with the camera sensor). This can be achieved by the app telling the module that the activity's UI is now in orientation, which the module will interpret not as per se, rather as ""rotate the camera feed 90 degrees I think by now it should be clear why we need to distinguish between and but just for completeness the activity supports landscape-left orientation as well, then this is how your screen will look like if you rotate your device 90 degrees clockwise (relative to portrait): The top-left pixel is still near the A corner as far as the camera sensor is concerned, but now that pixel needs to go to the 'b' corner of the view. In this case the module would have to rotate the camera feed clockwise by 90 degrees. If we can't distinguish between these two cases landscape-left and then the best we can do is to rotate the camera feed by 90 degrees in the same direction in both cases, which will mean that the camera feed will appear off by 180-degrees upside-down) to the user in one of those cases. Similar logic applies to portrait vs. A work around would be to recreate orientation change handling in the module, however the better solution should be to improve this handling in the Titanium SDK so that the app can notify the module using Titanium SDK available about this change instead of the module needing to unnecessarily replicate Titanium SDK capabilities just to improve them. This works as expected in the iOS Titanium SDK.",3635

5845,TIMOB-18401,timob,moshebox@gmail.com,description,2015-01-16 09:27:00,"two years ago I developed an iOS module that wrapped around Google Maps for iOS SDK to return support for Google maps on Titanium projects. this worked fine and with every major Titanium SDK release I rebuilt, tested and it always worked fine. I used to run it using run but that doesn't work anymore, instead I run python which works although it will not run in simulator which adds up to development time. the thing is that when I tried xcrun lipo -info .a I only got i386 so I had to recreate a new module using the new titanium CLI, change the GUID and add my objective c classes and Google framework setup guide to it. then after building again I managed to get it to support all architectures, so you may want to update the docs for veteran module developers. now for the main issue: I use the module in a 10 lines demo app which just opens a window and adds an instance of Google maps, I build it with SDK and it runs fine in the simulator. I also used the latest version of Google's framework I then simply changed the to use instead, the simulator opened, I see my debug printouts and then the app crashes, according to xcode it crashes due to a memory release that was not allocated. malloc: set a breakpoint in to debug I tried to set the above breakpoint, I tried to see the xcode stack when it crashes but it is of no use, it crashes somewhere in the tile drawing of the Google Maps framework but it will not do so if run through SDK Fact is, that from all the components used here the only variable that changed is the Titanium SDK version. so my guess is something in the list of changes of the new SDK broke something and some of the older apps won't work anymore. This module is used by many Titanium developers and is bundled with their published apps. to sum up: 1. module + SDK + Google SDK works 2. module + SDK + Google SDK crash 3. xCode project + Google SDK + sample app works 4. older module build compiled months ago + SDK crash attached is a sample project. it has a module folder with three versions, the was built with and supports 64-bit, the rest are older 32-bit only created with older SDKs and earlier) you will need to get the Google SDK you will also need to tell the module where to find the google framework in the file per the module docs if you need a license key for it drop me an email : canufind1 at gmail",2348

We are developing the application for about 2-3 years now, and we can confirm that the code worked prior upgrading to Moreover, the iOS version of our app does not have this problem even after upgrading the SDK. Our application is quite complex, and one of the core features is the integration with web applications provided by our platform. In order this integration to work, we heavily rely on invoking Javascript functions in the webView context in order to retrieve some data, or identify what steps should be taken. Since we are not allowed to share any productive code, I have prepared a code snippet that presents the issue: And this is the sample HTML file (note that the Javascript function is the same as the one we try to invoke using evalJS in it is left just for reference without invoking it): When uting the above we get the following error: After some time (if we wait enough) we get the attached screenshot in Genymotion simulator (no clue where this comes from). Until now, the workaround for us was to rollback to the previous Titanium SDK Now, given the fact that Apple will also release the new iOS8 soon, we expect that new Titanium SDK would be rolled out as well, one that we must upgrade to, since iOS8 is a must for us. However, this Android issue is also a blocker, putting us in deadlock situation. I have noticed that there are few other JIRA issues similar to ours. However, I'm not sure if the cause is really the same (one of the issues says that this happens on with API17 but we are experiencing it on with API16).

6271,TIMOB-16488,timob,ingo,description,2014-03-18 18:08:32,"h3. Issue After a revision from customer Vulnerability assessment team they have raised a low priority issue in reference that the Property List lacks of Secure Class Protection - The list of files they are referring to is basically everything in the installed package on the device h3. Description On iOS, every file is encrypted with an unique encryption key as illustrated in the image. The content of a file is encrypted with a per-file key, which is wrapped with a class key (data protection class key) and stored in a file metadata, which is in turn encrypted with the file system key (EMF key). The file system key is generated from the hardware UID. UID is unique per device and it is embedded in hardware and inaccessible to code running on CPU. A file which is encrypted only with the file system key, upon physical access to the device custom ramdisk techniques can be used to steal the file from passcode protected devices. To overcome this problem Data protection was introduced. Data protection protects the data at rest on iOS devices using encryption keys that are tied to the device passcode and UID. So if the file is protected with a data protection class and the user sets a passcode for the device, an attacker cannot access the file using custom ram disk technique until he knows the passcode. Data protection provides another layer of security to files by encrypting them with a passcode generated key. File protection is enabled by setting an accessibility constant to file attribute. Later the files are encrypted with a protection class key respective to the accessibility constant marked for that file. Ex: If a file is marked with accessibility constant then the file is encrypted with Class 1 protection class key and it is available only when the user unlocks the device. If a file is created without specifying any accessibility constant then the file is marked as and it is accessible even the device is locked . List of accessibility constants available for files are shown in the below table. h3. iOS Reference",2044

Problem Description The 320x180 image in the testcase should be scaled UP to fill the width of the window (left: 0, right: 0) with it's height automatically adjusted to maintain the image aspect ratio. This is exactly what happens on iOS. On android, the is contstrained to the original image height, and the image's aspect ratio is maintained, thus leaving a large unfilled area to the left and right of the image. Since the size is set to the expected behaviour would be that the image is scaled up to fit the full width of the ImageView and it's size adjusted upward to fit the contents of the scaled up image.

This bug blocks me from allowing users to open my app by using an URL scheme on a webpage or in a email message, send to them when they lost their password, received an invite to play a game etc. h1. Why use launchMode? By default, when launching your app via another app, using an URL scheme in the browser, your apps main activity will be stacked onto the current app's task.

This works fine, but not when the app's main window is HeavyWeight, for example a or a with . h1. To reproduce Create a new project: Build (only) to generate manifest: Open the generated and copy the first under . You will need to create the empty elements yourself. Add to the .

The only complication would be that the require() and include() functions might need a flag to know whether the app has been bootstrapped or not (ie read from ""framework"" if bootstrapping and ""assets"" if not). A flag may not be sufficient if things are done asynchronously so the other solution would be to check if the file calling the is in ""framework"" or ""assets"" and make sure to load the file from the same directory.

""The ""Extending Titanium"" set of guides might be a good starting point: There will need to be a C C++ API for module developers. You can look at the API documentation for Android and iOS to get an idea of what sort of native API we expose for extensions. Module developers should be able to create their own proxy and views. Need to also figure out how these external modules get compiled into the application. I am guess module developers will provide some sort of static dynamic library that gets included into the application. For application developers they use the require() function to load these external modules. So you will need to add support into your require implementation to search for these external modules if it can't find any files in the applications resources folder. For external modules we use the module's ID string for the require lookup. Ex: We also support external CommonJS modules. The Titanium Cloud module is an example of this type of module. This document provides some details: Basically this allows module developers to distribute JS only modules. This works by extending the require() search path to include these modules when the application developers adds them to their section. So I hope that gives you a good starting line. Feel free to ask for detailed questions on each of these requirements. We should also loop in the module team and work closely with them on any requirements they require for creating modules for BB.

The app seems to show a black background for 1-2 seconds and then restarts. I can reproduce this issue 3 out of 5 times, by doing the following: If you have the KitchenSink app open in memory from before, kill it. We want to make sure we start from a clean slate. Make sure you have your USB cable connected to your laptop and phone. Run the KitchenSink app, wait for it to load and press the home button (don't press the back button, but instead the home button!) Run a few other apps in the background, I ran 'Gmail', 'Contacts', 'Internet', 'Peep', 'Places', 'Stocks' and 'Market'. It's important that you press the home button and NOT the back button! (NOTE if it doesn't work for you the first time, try opening more or even less apps, it might make a difference, depending on the device's specs). Once you have some apps running in the background, make sure you are back on the main home screen. Press the power button (lock your screen, turn the screen off, but don't power the device off!) Unplug the USB cable. Unlock your phone. Press on the KitchenSink app icon. Expect to see a black background for a second or two and then it will restart the app. If you don't, repeat from step 1. -Different apps behave differently. The KitchenSink app, for example, seems to show a black background for 1-2 seconds and then restart the whole app. Other apps, such as Mister (from Google Play), actually shows a black screen and never continues to do anything else.

Proposed Solution(s) It would be good if you could specify by default whether you want to use the x86 or standard emulator for all projects, perhaps in . It should be the standard emulator by default as the x86 emulator currently does not include the Google APIs (which would prevent the KitchenSink from running) and it does not support V8, as detailed in the linked ticket. Also, it should be configurable on a per-project basis as well, for the same reasons I listed in the above paragraph. So: We need to upgrade our AVI detection to show the available ABIs per device For devices with multiple ABIs we need to allow the user to select which one to use as part of the launch configuration, and that is passed as the first argument to the SDK for SDKs For < we only pass the device argument We could add a preference in Titanium Preferences to default to x86 or standard emulator (were available).

7745,TISTUD-6541,tistud,stereoket,description,2014-05-19 22:35:38,"I have noticed that the formatter used within the Studio application has a number of issues that are causing me and my team a lot of difficulties when working with different tools and attempting to maintain a high level of code quality. 1. Studio reformats functions and var declarations within functions incorrectly. I say incorrect as it can cause JSHint errors afterwards also existing formatting applied, say by developer A, gets reformatted by Studio when developer B edits the documents. Here is an example of a small function example that has been formatted with Sublime Text 2 and passes JSHint. It is also the style that I wish to use, which also is recommended in many books regarding code quality with JavaScript. If this is copy pasted into Studio, and you use the Source Format option, by default or with custom settings, a few things happen that break the styling and flow. The ""use strict""; statement is placed immediately to the right of the opening brace, the variables are all moved onto a single line, and switch statements re-indent themselves. This is very frustrating when you are working on multiple branches of a project and the commits are going back and forth due to formatting changes made by the product. Take a look at what Studio does to the code example: The case should be indented with the switch, the vars should stay on a newline and the ""use strict""; should not move. This raises a wider question as why we can't use JSBeautifer rules tags for certain settings. The formatting options and rules probably would better serve us if they adopted more of this standard approach that is more widely adopted. (just an idea). My main issue is this current reformatting. Key Issues that need to be addressed: var declarations on newlines should not all be placed on a single line * switch statements should not indent cases.",1851

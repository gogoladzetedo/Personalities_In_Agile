332,XD-3100,xd,lukasz.nowanski@emc.com,description,2015-05-26 07:47:52.316,"Using 1 when deploying taps causes duplication of messages in those modules. This impacts balancing of the containers and modules in a cluster as messages should not be duplicated across modules if the same module is deployed twice to two containers in order to spread the load. We use taps quite heavily in our project mainly for analytics of the life feed in real time but due to issue we have discovered and described in this bug we are currently facing a limitation where heavily processing modules can not be load balanced across the cluster as they are causing duplication of the messages and therefore the same module deployed to two containers would still process the same message twice. To demonstrate the problem please see test case scenario set up below: h4. 1. Environment - Spring-XD version - Running two spring-xd containers and one spring-xd admin h4. 2. Set up Stream definition is as follows: stream create ""syslog-udp transform log"" stream deploy stream create transform + ""TAPPED ""' log"" stream deploy Please refer to the screen shots attached to see that after deploying those two streams we have: - streams successfully deployed ( ) - streams successfully deployed with count 2 to both containers ( ) - 5 queues created in Rabbit ( ) where two were created for the syslog-udp collector as a result of using - this is causing messages to be duplicated. Normally the expectation would be to have only one queue for the tap h4. 3. Test input data I have sent a very simple UDP message to the listening udp collector running on second container: echo h4. 4. Test output data in the logs ( and ) h5. Expected result: Below messages logged only on 1 container (it does not matter which one) INFO - Below message logged only on one container (it does not matter which one) INFO - TAPPED h5. Actual result: Stream that has been create as a tap has duplicated the same message and as a result the same message was proccessed twice on both containers by the same module ( transformer ) and logged twice to the console on both containers Container01: INFO - TAPPED Container02: INFO - INFO - TAPPED",2110

The listener for that channel will receive a message, be able to take the and other launch information from the message, and be able to launch run the job. NOTE: I can see a few other stories that should probably be made to break this up after writing it. I put estimate of 10 for now, but we should break this up. Here are some suggestions 1. create data only equivalent with primitive types 2. create jobLauncher source 3. create processor 4. Refactoring of aliasHing to use a callback strategy. job create helloWorldJob ""myjob The XD-Container that receives the deploy request message will create a module application context, will also create a channel with the Channel registry named after the job, :myJob. This should be a pub sub channel from the point of view of the middleware. From the point of view of the spring integration channel, it should ideally be of the utor channel. There is a limitation in the current implementation of now as only creates direct channels. The boolean aliasHint should probably be extended to some type of callback that creates a channel. The aliasHint was added to address the case of creating or looking up a queue backed channel or a direct channel. There will be a consumer on the SI channel in the module application context that will be responsible for getting the job launch information and launching the job. The launching of the job may need to be explicitly done in a separate thread if direct channels are created by the The contents of the message should be something similar to the current it needs to be easily serializable with simple types via JSON over the wire. The current impl of has ObjectMapper, so that may require a bit of reworking. The handler of the message will use the jobLauncher to launch the job, using the information in the How to verify it works* With the test we should be able to create the job job create helloSpringXD ""myjob"" This will not launch the job (as mentioned in the section.

1640,DNN-8141,dnn,george.alatrash,description,2015-12-22 00:45:21.859,"A moniker is a simple name provided for an objects that simplifies identifying specific object instances. This concept was first used in Microsoft Object Linking and Embedding (OLE), and the Component Object Model (COM). The DNN Services Framework was first introduced in DNN When creating web services with the Service Framework, it is common to require callers to provide the ModuleId and TabId as part of the web request header. This requirement complicates the programming model since service endpoints become tied to their specific location in a website. Modules are able to easily retrieve the ModuleId and TabId from the service framework as part of the initial module rendering. However, this mechanism is not available for remote callers, where the UI rendering is not directly controlled by DNN. In order to encapsulate this context data and to simplify the programming model for web services, we should introduce the concept of a moniker. The DNN service moniker will provide a mechanism for mapping a simple name to a specific module instance. This moniker can then be passed to a web service in place of the ModuleId, TabId or any other context data specific to a module. The moniker should be implemented as an additional system TabModule setting. By default, the moniker will be composed of the page name, the module definition friendly name and the TabModuleId separated by . When composing the default moniker, all spaces should be replaced with dashes. For example, if the Social Groups module was on the Community page with TabModuleId of 100, the default moniker would be The default moniker implementation provides a human friendly method to identify the page and module being addressed and also a unique element to differentiate between multiple modules on the same page. The core platform should expose a service endpoint that allows an application to query for monikers related to a specific module type that the current user has permissions to view. When calling service endpoints that need a specific module context, the moniker will be included as part of the service call. The service can then use the moniker to easily lookup any context for the module instance associated with the moniker. The purpose of this step is to help the back-end to create the DNN context for the web API request. Therefore, it is not tied to any authentication mechanism (like JWT, Basic, Forms, Injecting the moniker in the query part of the API request requires modifying all existing APIs that need to use this moniker but is not feasible and requires making changes to existing core (which we want to completely avoid). What we need is a non-invasive method. One way in which this can be implemented is by adding a new vendor specific header in the request as an alternate way to using the and that are in use today. Assume we are going to use for this purpose. An example of a full header would be: Before being able to use this feature, there is a need for an API that returns the various monikers associated with a specific module. Lets say in an EVOQ Engage site if we need to find all the monikers that use the discussions module, say discussions all tabs pages that have the discussions module in them), we will send an API request that returns all of these monikers associated with discussion modules placed on various pages. This call may return zero, one, or more monikers. There must be a consideration for user rights in every data returned from the API; no private data should be revealed to an un-authorized user.",3537

I saw this couple times with Host user and CM user account, looks like it could happen to any user. Here is some investigation Ben did and some findings from his updates, I copy paste his email below for ppl to understand the problem. Hi Bing & Ash, The login cookie issue caused by and edge case and its not a real bug, the problem occur caused in that server, all child sites added into a site group but parent site not, so in this case: 1. When login from child site, cookies will save as local cookie and have expire date; 2. When login from parent site, cookies will save as session cookie. In this case, if you both open child site and parent site in different tabs in same browser, and when authentication timeout reached(in forms node, timeout default value is 60 minutes), membership will try to extend cookie, so that it will create duplicate cookie, you can verify with below steps: 1. Change set timeout to 3, so no need wait for a long time; 2. Open child site and login as host; 3. Open parent site in another tab in same browser, now it should also already login; 4. And wait for 5 minutes, then check cookies, you will see 2 cookies. so we need notice that when create site groups, we need avoid that cookie name may shares with sites which not in site group, and IMO no need code fix for this problem, the workaround is just close browser and open again. Thanks, Ben Zhong Senior Developer And generally when this happening, in Cookies list, you will see 2 items, same cookies name, but different values.",1590

Showing Common when an item has been bookmarked When a user has bookmarked a module tile in the control bar, from that point on, their default view should be the 'common' list, showing their bookmarked tiles. This works when a tile is first bookmarked, but refreshing the page goes back to the 'All' view. It is important to show only the common view to make it more usable. h2. Search all modules When the 'Add Module' drop down is clicked, the focus is put into the 'search' box, which is good. However, if the search shows the 'common' view (as per the previous requirement) - the search will not find matching items in the 'All' box. This needs to change so that if no search results are found for the current context (assuming it is not 'all'), the search will be run again, but in the 'All' category. As this is a two-step process, the message should show 'No Modules Available in 'Common', Searching with the same searching icon. The second search is done in the context of 'All'. h2. Use Mouse Scroll Wheel to horizontally scroll. To make the scroll work even more intuitively, hook up an event to the mouse scroll wheel, so that when the pointer is over the add modules pane, the scroll wheel scrolls the items left and right. Scrolling 'down' (wheel spinning from front to back) should scroll the bar towards the right (ie, show more).

It exposes a number of basic options which a developer will need to provide in order to create a custom module: Owner Name: DotNetNuke requires a unique top level namespace to ensure uniqueness. The owner name could be an organization name, brand name, developers name, The system will save the value provided as a Host Setting so that it can be used as a default for any modules created in the future. Module Name: A short name to identify the purpose of the module Description: Optional. A description of the module Language: C or VB. The default is C . Changing the selection reloads the list of Templates. Template: A list of templates loaded dynamically based on the Language selected. It will only display templates of type Module. There are 3 different dynamic module models which can be utilized based on preference Inline Script, User Control, and Razor. The default will be Module User Control. When a user selects a template, it will load and display an associated file ( if one exists ). The file can contain a description of the template files, but it can also include code samples which could be cut and pasted into the module control to add additional functionality. Control Name: Modules can contain multiple controls. This option allows the user to specify the name of the file created. The default will be View When the developer presses the Create Module button it will register the module in the database, create a module category for the Owner and associate it to the module, and update the ModuleDefID of the module instance with the ModuleDefID of the newly registered module. The end result is that the Module Creator module will be replaced on the page with the new module created. At this point the module is fully usable within the environment and the developer can browse to the page where it is located using the standard website navigation.",2650
2668,APSTUD-4895,apstud,ccrayton@viewkeeper.org,description,2012-06-13 17:40:33.000,"My notebook computer, also running Aptana 3, now has the same issue as my desktop. I have now verified this issue on two different computers, both Windows 7 x64. I followed all of instructions in email, attached my theme, reset defaults on annotations and set defaults on theme and as you can see from the attached the issue remains. In order to fix this I need to go to preferences aptana studio themes and press ""reset defaults"" Every time I start I need to go do that reset defaults. I don't think it's the theme: something buggy happens when Aptana initializes that changes something in my settings. Having to go through settings to undo it is lame, and it has to be a change that happened with the latest upgrade. Please get someone to fix :) After latest upgrade, highlighted text color (PyDev editor) is opaque and changing theme colors does not work reliably. All themes show behavior like the attached screenshot: the highlighted text foreground and background are the same color. Changing selected foreground colors does not work as expected: selecting a dark-colored selection background results in a light-colored background. Selecting the theme override for seems to fix the issue for the current session, but when I shut down Aptana and restart the highlight is broken again, even though the little 'B' icon next to is still selected. I need to click it off and back on again to fix the highlight, which again only works until I restart. I've been using Aptana without issues for at least 6 months prior to this issue, and have not touched color settings in months. The latest update seems to have broken theme handling. MOTE UPDATES: See attached. If you look closely, I selected a very dark gray(almost back) color for the line highlight and Aptana is using a bright gray. Any color I choose for the line highlight is ignored, and Aptana chooses a much brighter color. Aptana is just ignoring my setting for selected text altogether. MORE UPDATES: I have had two instances today where I started Aptana, went in and changed so that I could see highlighted text (the broken bug is 100% repeatable). After switching to another window and switching back the highlight was broken again, requiring me to change the setting again. This is profoundly irritating. I hope whatever change broke color handling was awesome enough to cause this much pain.",2358

2691,APSTUD-4840,apstud,neill,description,2012-05-21 06:16:55.000,"This is a clone of bug APSTUD 4661 as I made the following comment on it, but I guess because that bug was deemed fixed, the comment went unnoticed. I've included the previous bug description after the new additional problem description. The previous bug was not correctly fixed and the following describes the remaining, rather peculiar, issue. I've upgraded to Aptana Studio 3, build: and have tested the following on Mageia and Ubuntu If I turn off the Refresh checkbox, save and view it again it remains off. If I close down Aptana and restart it, the checkbox remains off. If I close Aptana, log out, log back in again, and restart Aptana and view it, it remains off. The same is true if I don't close Aptana before logging out. However, if I reboot my machine, log in and then restart Aptana, it is now back on again. In other words, the setting doesn't seem to survive a reboot. I would guess this hints that the value is somehow being kept in memory and linux is reassigning that portion of memory to Aptana during the restarts of Aptana and even over a log out and log in again. Don't know if that is possible, but I can't imagine why it's misbehaving only on a reboot otherwise. Steps to reproduce: a) log in to either Mageia or Ubuntu or possibly other variants of linux or other OSes(haven't tested on those) b) start up Aptana and turn OFF the Refresh button c) REBOOT your machine d) log in again and start up Aptana, and view the value. All things going well it's back on again. Who'd have thought one checkbox could be so mysterious!! The original bug description was I've just upgraded to the latest aptana release and immediately hitting cpu usage issues with the CPU jumping to 90%ish every few seconds corresponding to a refresh of the workspace every few seconds. So I guess on my system Aptana the option 'Refresh using Native hooks or polling' is polling rather than hooks as it happens regardless of whether or not I'm doing anything. I've traced it down to the 'Refresh using Native Hooks or Polling' which is under the Workspace menu. If I turn it off, the system quietens down and all is fine. However, on a restart, this 'option' has re options saved (or perhaps isn't getting saved to the file?) So the bug I'm reporting here is the preference can't be set beyond a restart and, of course, like all preferences it should be. A second bug I guess is quite why the refresh of the workspace uses so much CPU - my system has 8000 files on a fairly old machine so I'm guessing it's hitting limits on my machine (results will of course vary on other machines). I've commented on that before (in the forums) and it was all fine in version 3 until now. I'll repeat my guess that there is a very inefficient method involved in the refresh of the workspace that still hasn't been resolved. Anyway - hopefully to replicate Type Workspace in to the preferences and select Workspaces at the bottom to get the ""Refresh "" option. Unselect it. Restart the studio, go back to that preference and you'll (hopefully) see it selected again. I've attached two images - the first when I deselected the option. The second when I restarted showing the option has been selected again.",3188

2918,APSTUD-4113,apstud,ingo,description,2012-01-30 10:48:56,"From Handling functions is a bit different than any other type in the type system. Functions derive from ""Object"". As a result, new properties can be added to function instances. Functions also my be invoked, taking a possibly empty list of arguments and possibly returning a value. The type system keeps track of these two bits of information in separate locations. If properties are added to the Function, then a new sub-type of Function is created. However, parameters and return values are captured on the property that references the function type. This makes for some difficulties in the current inferencing engine. As we infer types for nodes in an AST, we need to be able to determine return types of invoked functions. We do this using a function signature: We are able to use the return type list for invocations. So, when we ask for the type of a property, we always return a string value. When asking for the type of a function property specifically, we need to return a function signature. This notion was confused and the Function aspect of the signature was used as the type name as well. This causes all sorts of problems and needs to be removed. For example, the jQuery library is defined by an sdocml file. Its constructors return a jQuery type; however, internally, we say that the jQuery global method is of type ""Function"". So, any time we see the type ""jQuery"", we have to map it to ""Function"". By removing the notion of ""Function wrapper refactor existing classes to use unity methods",1507

It is wrapped in ""Function aspect of the signature was used as the type name as well. We really only need Using ""Function"" makes it difficult to look up ""typeName"" since you have no idea when to use just ""typeName"" versus ""Function"". For example, the jQuery library is defined by an sdocml file. Its constructors return a jQuery type; however, internally, we say that the jQuery global method is of type ""Function"". So, any time we see the type ""jQuery"", we have to map it to ""Function"". By removing the notion of ""Function"" notation. If a function is being accessed like an object, then treating the function like any other object will be just fine. For example, in the following: If you place the cursor at ' ' and ask for content assist, then inferencing will look up abc's type and find that it is At this point, inferencing simply queries the index for ""abc"" and then displays all properties on that type in the proposal list. However, if you change the code slightly: Things get a little more challenging. is actually a ""get-property"" node with ""abc()"" on its left-hand side. This is further defined as an invoke node with an identifier node as a child. The child of an invoke node can be an arbitrary expression, so we can't rely on that child always being an identifier. This means that we have to infer the type of the child of the invoke node. In this case, we get ""abc"" which is type ""abc"". We're now at the line between types and properties. We access the ""abc"" type, but for purposes of invocation, we need the ""abc"" property, off of Window in this case, because that property tells us that it is a function that returns ""String"". It's type information doesn't tell us this. And this is were the challenge lies. The invocation node actually needs to infer what is called a Reference. A Reference is a tuple composed of an object and a property name. Inferencing has been setup to return type info as strings, so the fact that we need a Reference here breaks our inferencing code around function invocation. Remember that the child of JSInvokeNode has to be inferred. This could be an arbitrarily complex subtree that touches most of the current cases handled by the inferencing engine. The engine uses strings which implies we would have to build a parallel system to return a Reference instead. That would be a horrible maintenance pain in the neck. So, this is why inferencing uses function signatures. These can be returned as strings and it preserves the return type info of the function, all without having to use References and a parallel system for those. So, in theory, we should be able to simply remove ""Function< "" from the type name and then anywhere in inferencing where we need to differentiate between a function or a property, we can look up the ancestor chain of the type to determine if it derives from Function. Ideally, this could be cached in some way so we don't have to hit the index tons of times during inferencing. Even though we have a utility method to get a full ancestor chain of a type, this requires one read per ancestor type. For performance reasons, we should always minimize reads writes to the index if possible.",3284

They forwarded me to the Mozilla Website where they wrote that sience Firefox 4 the XULRunner is disables be default because of this security issues. is only for Firefox I know it's very much to ask, but i think it's a good idea if Aptana could run without the XULrunner. It's for advanced users not a big problem to reinstall the libs directly from the page, but if it's a mayor security rist, i think twice about that.

Status Quo Currently resources allocated to frameworks in a role with quota (aka quota'ed role) beyond quota guarantee are marked non-revocable. This impacts our flexibility for revoking them if we decide so in the future. h4. Proposal Once quota guarantee is satisfied we must not necessarily further allocate resources as non-revocable. Instead we can mark all offers resources beyond guarantee as revocable. When in the future evolves frameworks will get additional information about ""revocability"" of the resource allocation slack) h4. Caveats Though it seems like a simple change, it has several implications. h6. Fairness Currently the hierarchical allocator considers revocable resources as regular resources when doing fairness calculations. This may prevent frameworks getting non-revocable resources as part of their role's quota guarantee if they accept some revocable resources as well. Consider the following scenario. A single framework in a role with quota set to CPUs is allocated CPUs as non-revocable resources as part of its quota and additionally revocable CPUs. Now a task using non-revocable CPUs finishes and its resources are returned. Total allocation for the role is non-revocable + revocable. However, the role may not be offered additional non-revocable since its total allocation satisfies quota. h6. Resource math If we allocate non-revocable resources as revocable, we should make sure we do accounting right: either we should update total agent resources and mark them as revocable as well, or bookkeep resources as non-revocable and convert them to revocable when necessary. h6. Coarse-grained nature of allocation The hierarchical allocator performs allocation, meaning it always allocates the entire remaining agent resources to a single framework. This may lead to some resources as non-revocable beyond quota guarantee. h6. Quotas smaller than fair share If a quota set for a role is smaller than its fair share, it may reduce the amount of resources offered to this role, if frameworks in it do not accept revocable resources. This is probably the most important consequence of the proposed change. Operators may set quota to get guarantees, but may observe a decrease in amount of resources a role gets, which is not intuitive.",2270

This guards Systemd from migrating the pids that are descendants of the process launched by a Systemd unit. In order for this strategy to work, the flag must be supported by the Systemd version. Support for this was introduced in Systemd v218; however, it has also been backported to v208 for RHEL7 and CentOS7 with the package . It is highly recommended to upgrade to this package if running those operating systems. Once the flag has been set, the cgroups that are manually manipulated by the agent will no longer be migrated . This still leaves the problem of tasks being migrated after the agent has stopped running (voluntarily or not). In order to deal with the problem we propose the following solution: If an agent is running on a Systemd initialized machine, then the agent will create a Systemd slice with a life-time that is independent of the agent and . The linux launcher (used when cgroups isolators are enabled) will then assign the cgroup name for any utor that is launched to this separate slice. The consequence of this is that when the agent unit is terminated, the separate slice will continue to delegate the cgroups preventing Systemd from migrating the pids. A side benefit of this is that we can maintain the flag on the agent and terminate all agent specific services such as the without terminating the tasks. This provides for a nice clean-up. This solution will still require that the agent unit be launched with the flag such that there is no race during the transition of the pids from the agent to the separate slice. The agent will be responsible for verifying the slice is still available upon recovery, and warning the operator if it notices that the tasks it is recovering are no longer associated with this separate slice, as this can cause loss of isolation of existing tasks.",1961

This allows to test different implementation of an interface. In our code, it tests default and a module which uses the same default The class needs a little explanation, it is a wrapper around which allows the tests to encode information about the requested module in the type itself instead of passing a string to the factory method. The wrapper around create, the real important method looks as follows: Problem Consider the following implementation of : As it can be seen, this implementation cannot be used as a default implementation since its create API does not match the one of : has a different signature for both types. It is still a common situation to require initialization parameters for objects, however this constraint (keeping both interfaces alike) forces default of modularized components to have default constructors, therefore the tests are forcing the design of the interfaces. which are supposed to be used as modules only, non default are allowed to have constructor parameters, since the actual signature of their factory method is, this factory method's function is to decode the parameters and call the appropriate constructor: where parameters is just an array of key-value string pairs whose interpretation is left to the specific module. Sadly, this call is wrapped by which only allows module parameters to be passed from the command line and does not offer a programmatic way to feed construction parameters to modules. Ugly Workaround With the requirement of a default constructor and parameters devoid factory function, a common pattern (see ) has been introduced to feed construction parameters into default this leads to adding an call to the public interface, which will have become: will thus look as follows: Look that this method now has to be implemented by all descendants of , even if there's a which takes is return value for from a DB, it will need to support as an initialization parameter.

3713,MESOS-2735,mesos,benjaminhindman,Comment,2015-05-20 00:42:56.224,"There are definitely differences in message queue behavior, one of which is significantly safer than the other. There are two safety concerns that I can think of, one of which has addressed here but I'll repeat to be sure I properly understood. (1) Someone might write a that isn't asynchronous, causing the slave to ""block"" while the resource estimator estimates. (2) The might cause a denial of service attack on the slave. I understand the concern with (1) but I'm not too anxious about it. Why? It should be trivial to make a wrapper module which forces people to implement the to be asynchronous, either using `async` like you suggested or implementing a version of which wraps an actor (libprocess process). We'll only need to do this once and then other implementations can leverage this stuff. On the other hand, I don't like the behavior of push because of (2). Fundamentally, if the slave can't keep up with the rate at which the is pushing then we could create a denial of service issue with the slave, it takes a long time to process messages because it's queue is full of just messages. I'm more anxious about (2) than (1) because it's harder to find bugs in (2) than with (1) since once you fix (1) it stays fixed forever but any time you updated the algorithm you impact the potential to cause (2). Now, I acknowledge that implementing this as a pull versus push will make the implementation in the slightly more complicated, but not really. In particular, it should be trivial to always use a `Queue` to achieve the push semantics in any implementation, while still providing the pull semantics externally. Make sense? Finally, one of the advantages of the pull model is that it's easier to reason about because we don't have ""anonymous"" lambdas that cause ution in some other random place in the code you can easily see in the slave where the future that gets returned from gets handled). In addition, the remains ""functional"" in the sense that it just has to return some value (or a future) from it's functions versus invoking some callback that causes something to get run some other place (and in fact, may also block, so isn't it safer for the to invoke the callback in it's own `async`?). The invocation of the followed by the is a nice pattern that let's us compose with other things as well, which is harder to do with the lambda style callbacks and why we've avoided it where we've been able (in fact, I'm curious which place in the code are you imitating here?).",2488

3874,MESOS-1817,mesos,nnielsen,description,2014-09-19 00:18:32.272,"We have run into a problem that cause tasks which completes, when a framework is disconnected and has a fail-over time, to remain in a running state even though the tasks actually finishes. This hogs the cluster and gives users a inconsistent view of the cluster state. Going to the slave, the task is finished. Going to the master, the task is still in a non-terminal state. When the scheduler reattaches or the failover timeout expires, the tasks finishes correctly. The current workflow of this scheduler has a long fail-over timeout, but may on the other hand never reattach. Here is a test framework we have been able to reproduce the issue with: It launches many short-lived tasks (1 second sleep) and when killing the framework instance, the master reports the tasks as running even after several minutes: When clicking on one of the slaves where, for example, task 49 runs; the slave knows that it completed: Here is the log of a mesos-local instance where I reproduced it: (Here task 10 to 19 are stuck in running state). There is a lot of output, so here is a filtered log for task 10: The problem turn out to be an issue with the ack-cycle of status updates: If the framework disconnects (with a failover timeout set), the status update manage on the slaves will keep trying to send the front of status update stream to the master (which in turn forwards it to the framework). If the first status update after the disconnect is terminal, things work out fine; the master pick the terminal state up, removes the task and release the resources. If, on the other hand, one non-terminal status is in the stream. The master will never know that the task finished (or failed) before the framework reconnects. During a discussion on the dev mailing list ( we enumerated a couple of options to solve this problem. First off, having two ack-cycles: one between masters and slaves and one between masters and frameworks, would be ideal. We would be able to replay the statuses in order while keeping the master state current. However, this requires us to persist the master state in a replicated storage. As a first pass, we can make sure that the tasks caught in a running state doesn't hog the cluster when completed and the framework being disconnected. Here is a to work out of: A new (optional) field have been added to the internal status update message: Which makes it possible for the status update manager to set the field, if the latest status was terminal: I added a test which should high-light the issue as well: I would love some input on the approach before moving on. There are rough edges in the PoC which (of course) should be addressed before bringing it for up review.",2689

Refresh tokens are issued to the client by the authorization server and are used to obtain a new access token when the current access token becomes invalid or expires, or to obtain additional access tokens with identical or narrower scope (access tokens may have a shorter lifetime and fewer permissions than authorized by the resource owner). Issuing a refresh token is optional at the discretion of the authorization server. If the authorization server issues a refresh token, it is included when issuing an access token step (D) in Figure 1). More detail about this in: Successful Response The authorization server issues an access token and optional refresh token, and constructs the response by adding the following parameters to the entity-body of the HTTP response with a 200 (OK) status code: access token REQUIRED. The access token issued by the authorization server. token type REQUIRED. The type of the token issued as described in Section Value is case insensitive. expires in RECOMMENDED. The lifetime in seconds of the access token. For example, the value ""3600"" denotes that the access token will expire in one hour from the time the response was generated. If omitted, the authorization server SHOULD provide the expiration time via other means or document the default value. refresh token OPTIONAL. The refresh token, which can be used to obtain new access tokens using the same authorization grant as described in Section 6. scope OPTIONAL, if identical to the scope requested by the client; otherwise, REQUIRED. The scope of the access token as described by Section Current implementation of OAuth2 is expecting always to get refresh token so if the OAuth2 server during a refresh token operation sends only the access token Mule is failing to get the refresh token with the following exception: h5. Proposed Solution As described in the spec if there is a refresh token issued by the OAuth2 server it should be used for getting new access tokens if not it should fail when the current access token is no longer valid (after a 401 403 status code and before retrying the request) and a exception of type should be thrown.

Watermarking Right now, when a poll needs to deal with updated objects, we use watermarks as an approach to filter out elements that were already processed. Watermarks require a value to be persisted across flow invocations. Typically, this value will have a default the first time used, and will be used as part of a query or outbound request. Based on how the flow processes the results, the value may be updated. This can be done using several steps: - Fetch a value form a persistent object store and save it as a flow variable - Refer to the flow variable when doing a query outbound request - Update the variable based (either once - the watermark is the date of the query, or per record - the watermark is the highest id from an object) - At the end of the processing, persist the value to the persistent object store This pattern is very common in flows. Enough common to deserve better support. To make this easier out of the box we will add a new optional parameter to that will provide the watermarking variable persistence out of the box. Watermark Example: h2. Watermark properties (required): In case that the key above can't be found on the object store, the default expression is used to generate a value. This is useful for the first run of the flow (optional): A reference to the object store you wish to use to store the watermarks. If not provided, the default object store will be used h2. Watermark behaviour When uted, it goes to the configured object store looking for a value of the given key. If found, that value is exposed through a flowVar using the same key. Watermark will also fire a notification interceptable by the event tracking module. The underlaying tracking event will be enriched with the watermark value. If the flow was correctly uted, then the watermark will be updated. If the intercepted processors throw any exceptions, then the watermark will not be updated. Since the watermark is stored in the object store, the user can always use a exception strategy to put a custom value in case of failure.",2048

After a lot of permuting through, I found the below reproducable case. There may be more. I'm 100% sure, for example, I have seen maven-public uneditable (took a screenshot - which I've attached). Hopefully this gives enough of a lead to investigate without me permuting through a bunch more items. If this seems familiar, it may be because of NEXUS-8517. I am creating a seperate ticket for several reasons. First, there was some skepticism if that ticket is about granting proper permissions (like a race condition to edit before the repo is editable). This is with default created repos so there shouldn't be such a race to my knowledge. Second, totally different set of steps. You'll note there actually isn't any actions besides view changes being done. Third, this seems to have nothing to do with timing (NEXUS-8517 ""goes away"" if you wait a very small amount of time). I waited a minute or more between each of the steps below (used a timer) to make sure of this. CMA repos are new to Dizzam so no previous NX3 testing can be done at this time.

It seems shady to me if we're loading an 80mb log in entirity to just get even 100K of no surprise that'd tax resources. Workaround would be to load the log via console.

5691,TIMOB-18956,timob,patakijv,description,2015-05-26 21:42:06,"The documentation confirms that this is missing from the various places where in Android you could detect orientation change. property never reports the ""reverse"" orientations* and Android itself does report the reverse orientation changes, Titanium is just not surfacing this level of reporting. This deficiency prevents being able to detect precisely to which orientation has the device been rotated to with respect to a view, such as a camera view needed for barcode scanning. When the device has rotated but the view (and the object which is the subject of the scanning) has not rotated, you must be able to determine what the relative rotation is without the possibility of being 180 degrees off. Let me try to illustrate how this becomes a problem with some ASCII art and the scenario being a barcode scanning camera view in a module where the app must report to the module the orientation change. This is just an example of 1 use case where this deficiency can be seen as a problem. Let's say this is your device in portrait orientation: ABCD are the corners of the hardware, abcd are the corners of the camera view. Let's say the camera sensor is mounted such that the top-left corner of the picture is nearest to the A corner, the top-right corner of the picture is nearest to the B corner, etc. In this case, the rotation difference between the camera sensor and the camera view is 0 degrees, so the pixel at the top-left corner of the picture can go near the 'a' corner of the view, the pixel at the top-right corner of the picture can go near the 'b' corner of the view, etc. If the activity supports orientation, then this is how your screen will look like if you rotate your device 90 degrees The important thing to realize is that the camera sensor rotated with the hardware but the view didn't, and neither did the object you are pointing the camera at. So the top-left pixel is still near the A corner as far as the camera sensor is concerned, but now that pixel needs to go to the 'c' corner of the view, otherwise from your (the user's) perspective the camera feed will look like it's rotated 90 degrees clockwise (because the object in front of the camera didn't rotate with the camera sensor). This can be achieved by the app telling the module that the activity's UI is now in orientation, which the module will interpret not as per se, rather as ""rotate the camera feed 90 degrees I think by now it should be clear why we need to distinguish between and but just for completeness the activity supports landscape-left orientation as well, then this is how your screen will look like if you rotate your device 90 degrees clockwise (relative to portrait): The top-left pixel is still near the A corner as far as the camera sensor is concerned, but now that pixel needs to go to the 'b' corner of the view. In this case the module would have to rotate the camera feed clockwise by 90 degrees. If we can't distinguish between these two cases landscape-left and then the best we can do is to rotate the camera feed by 90 degrees in the same direction in both cases, which will mean that the camera feed will appear off by 180-degrees upside-down) to the user in one of those cases. Similar logic applies to portrait vs. A work around would be to recreate orientation change handling in the module, however the better solution should be to improve this handling in the Titanium SDK so that the app can notify the module using Titanium SDK available about this change instead of the module needing to unnecessarily replicate Titanium SDK capabilities just to improve them. This works as expected in the iOS Titanium SDK.",3635

I used to run it using run but that doesn't work anymore, instead I run python which works although it will not run in simulator which adds up to development time. the thing is that when I tried xcrun lipo -info .a I only got i386 so I had to recreate a new module using the new titanium CLI, change the GUID and add my objective c classes and Google framework setup guide to it. then after building again I managed to get it to support all architectures, so you may want to update the docs for veteran module developers. now for the main issue: I use the module in a 10 lines demo app which just opens a window and adds an instance of Google maps, I build it with SDK and it runs fine in the simulator. I also used the latest version of Google's framework I then simply changed the to use instead, the simulator opened, I see my debug printouts and then the app crashes, according to xcode it crashes due to a memory release that was not allocated. malloc: set a breakpoint in to debug I tried to set the above breakpoint, I tried to see the xcode stack when it crashes but it is of no use, it crashes somewhere in the tile drawing of the Google Maps framework but it will not do so if run through SDK Fact is, that from all the components used here the only variable that changed is the Titanium SDK version. so my guess is something in the list of changes of the new SDK broke something and some of the older apps won't work anymore. This module is used by many Titanium developers and is bundled with their published apps. to sum up: 1. module + SDK + Google SDK works 2. module + SDK + Google SDK crash 3. xCode project + Google SDK + sample app works 4. older module build compiled months ago + SDK crash attached is a sample project. it has a module folder with three versions, the was built with and supports 64-bit, the rest are older 32-bit only created with older SDKs and earlier) you will need to get the Google SDK you will also need to tell the module where to find the google framework in the file per the module docs if you need a license key for it drop me an email : canufind1 at gmail",2348

Issue After a revision from customer Vulnerability assessment team they have raised a low priority issue in reference that the Property List lacks of Secure Class Protection - The list of files they are referring to is basically everything in the installed package on the device h3. Description On iOS, every file is encrypted with an unique encryption key as illustrated in the image. The content of a file is encrypted with a per-file key, which is wrapped with a class key (data protection class key) and stored in a file metadata, which is in turn encrypted with the file system key (EMF key). The file system key is generated from the hardware UID. UID is unique per device and it is embedded in hardware and inaccessible to code running on CPU. A file which is encrypted only with the file system key, upon physical access to the device custom ramdisk techniques can be used to steal the file from passcode protected devices. To overcome this problem Data protection was introduced. Data protection protects the data at rest on iOS devices using encryption keys that are tied to the device passcode and UID. So if the file is protected with a data protection class and the user sets a passcode for the device, an attacker cannot access the file using custom ram disk technique until he knows the passcode. Data protection provides another layer of security to files by encrypting them with a passcode generated key. File protection is enabled by setting an accessibility constant to file attribute. Later the files are encrypted with a protection class key respective to the accessibility constant marked for that file. Ex: If a file is marked with accessibility constant then the file is encrypted with Class 1 protection class key and it is available only when the user unlocks the device. If a file is created without specifying any accessibility constant then the file is marked as and it is accessible even the device is locked . List of accessibility constants available for files are shown in the below table. h3. iOS Reference",2044

""The ""Extending Titanium"" set of guides might be a good starting point: There will need to be a C C++ API for module developers. You can look at the API documentation for Android and iOS to get an idea of what sort of native API we expose for extensions. Module developers should be able to create their own proxy and views. Need to also figure out how these external modules get compiled into the application. I am guess module developers will provide some sort of static dynamic library that gets included into the application. For application developers they use the require() function to load these external modules. So you will need to add support into your require implementation to search for these external modules if it can't find any files in the applications resources folder. For external modules we use the module's ID string for the require lookup. Ex: We also support external CommonJS modules. The Titanium Cloud module is an example of this type of module. This document provides some details: Basically this allows module developers to distribute JS only modules. This works by extending the require() search path to include these modules when the application developers adds them to their section. So I hope that gives you a good starting line. Feel free to ask for detailed questions on each of these requirements. We should also loop in the module team and work closely with them on any requirements they require for creating modules for BB.

The app seems to show a black background for 1-2 seconds and then restarts. I can reproduce this issue 3 out of 5 times, by doing the following: If you have the KitchenSink app open in memory from before, kill it. We want to make sure we start from a clean slate. Make sure you have your USB cable connected to your laptop and phone. Run the KitchenSink app, wait for it to load and press the home button (don't press the back button, but instead the home button!) Run a few other apps in the background, I ran 'Gmail', 'Contacts', 'Internet', 'Peep', 'Places', 'Stocks' and 'Market'. It's important that you press the home button and NOT the back button! (NOTE if it doesn't work for you the first time, try opening more or even less apps, it might make a difference, depending on the device's specs). Once you have some apps running in the background, make sure you are back on the main home screen. Press the power button (lock your screen, turn the screen off, but don't power the device off!) Unplug the USB cable. Unlock your phone. Press on the KitchenSink app icon. Expect to see a black background for a second or two and then it will restart the app. If you don't, repeat from step 1. -Different apps behave differently. The KitchenSink app, for example, seems to show a black background for 1-2 seconds and then restart the whole app. Other apps, such as Mister (from Google Play), actually shows a black screen and never continues to do anything else.

Specifically, the -scale argument in order to use skins whose full scale causes them to be larger than the screen you are running on. For example, I am using the Motorola MD860 skin for the Atrix 4G whose screen is 960 pixels high. The resulting emulator window is some 1200 pixels high but my screen is only 900 pixels high. If you run the AVD from the AVD Manager, it offers the option to run with a particular screen size which uses the -scale argument. We need the capability to do this in Studio. I would recommend simply adding an extensible option to specify any additional command line arguments. The standard Eclipse launch configurator allows this on the Target tab but that appears to be disabled in Studio. Note that there is indeed documentation relating to this in , however, the following needs to be taken into account when using it: The ""Temporary Change"" method is actually the correct way to accomplish what I am describing but, as noted, it's temporary. That method allows AVD to calculate an appropriate value for the emulator's ""-scale"" command line option before running it based on the desired virtual device's screen size and the density of the monitor the user is currently running AVD on. this does not alter the resolution of the virtual it is just causing the emulator to scale it's own window down. The ""Permanent Change"" method you added is dangerous from a testing perspective. You are instructing the developer to create a virtual device with a custom screen resolution that, in all likelihood, isn't representative of a physical device. The reason that AVD provides the custom resolution option is so that developers can create virtual devices which accurately represent physical devices that don't have a corresponding skin installed in their Android SDK environment.",1932

Studio reformats functions and var declarations within functions incorrectly. I say incorrect as it can cause JSHint errors afterwards also existing formatting applied, say by developer A, gets reformatted by Studio when developer B edits the documents. Here is an example of a small function example that has been formatted with Sublime Text 2 and passes JSHint. It is also the style that I wish to use, which also is recommended in many books regarding code quality with JavaScript. If this is copy pasted into Studio, and you use the Source Format option, by default or with custom settings, a few things happen that break the styling and flow. The ""use strict""; statement is placed immediately to the right of the opening brace, the variables are all moved onto a single line, and switch statements re-indent themselves. This is very frustrating when you are working on multiple branches of a project and the commits are going back and forth due to formatting changes made by the product. Take a look at what Studio does to the code example: The case should be indented with the switch, the vars should stay on a newline and the ""use strict""; should not move. This raises a wider question as why we can't use JSBeautifer rules tags for certain settings. The formatting options and rules probably would better serve us if they adopted more of this standard approach that is more widely adopted. (just an idea). My main issue is this current reformatting. Key Issues that need to be addressed: var declarations on newlines should not all be placed on a single line * switch statements should not indent cases.",1851

Problem description When a Warning or Error is found by the Code Analyzer for an Alloy project, Warning or Error icons are placed in the code gutter in the Resources file projects instead than in the App file projects. The result is that the Project is now marked with the red white error icon and the 'Errors in Workspace' alert is displayed every time the project is being build. 'Resources' folder is by default not visible for Alloy projects on Studio, so the default result is also that the project is marked with an error icon, but the user can't see any other red error icon next to any visible Project file. Also, having an error or a warning reported for the Alloy compiled code in the Resources folder is not adding much value for the user as the intended behavior is not to manually modify the compiled code files in the Resources (user should only handle Alloy files, all included into the App folder). h5. Steps to reproduce Paste the sample code. Note the code error in the , where foobar is actually not a function. The error is correctly reported by the Code Analyzer (see the screenshot), also getting the correct position in the Alloy project.

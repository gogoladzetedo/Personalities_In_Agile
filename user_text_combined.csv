However, we need to consider whether a separate configuration is needed to limit the number of batch jobs - it's possible the existing bus utor configuration is enough.. LocalMessageBus Will Only Run 10 Jobs by Default. This error surfaced recently as a result of a fix to a bug in which disabled this test in all environments. Now the test has been reactivated it is failing on the branch. The test runs OK on master.. This should probably be changed to: Documentation:. STS Gradle Import Missing Dependencies without Enabling Scala. Thanks to Gary I found this little gem of documentation to be able to use xpath expression in XD. Only hiccup is that I had to also add the to the classpath (otherwise it is missing XPathException class).. Add the Dependencies Required to Use xpath in Streams. Since the message-driven adapter uses a , the default behavior is to lose messages on exceptions (with the DMLC, the message is ack'd before the listener is invoked). In order to provide recovery of such situations, the source needs to expose so it can be set to . Or, perhaps, given that we don't expose complex configuration, the source should use a instead (where the ack is sent after the listener is successfully invoked).. Currently, you cannot suppress (or change) the prefix on user-defined headers. See Add $ property.. See With set with back-whacks, it fails on with set with whacks, it fails with . The StackOverflow failure is similar. works fine.. An additional commit ( for XD-2230 was applied only to master; it needs to be backported to.

But it's not clear to me how the filter module could be deployed bound as a consumer before the Gary Russell: I see the problem: binds the consumer before the producer - this is the wrong order for a passive component such as the filter. cc. When establishing the tap, we create the tap channel and add the WireTap before the tap channel has been bound to the bus. ERROR - Dispatcher has no subscribers for channel nested exception is Dispatcher has no subscribers at. Upgrade to Spring SI SA. Add a Retry Dead Letter Interceptor to the RabbitMQ Source. Provide for retry and or dead-lettering for the rabbit source (similar to the rabbit message bus).. It is documented here But maybe it should also be at the top of the appendix?. The JMS Source Sink has a pluggable provider (default ) but the URL property implies activeMQ - the property name should be generic (found while testing XD-1149).. Add Support for addresses Property on RabbitMQ Source. Documentation for data partitioning, and all Rabbit Bus properties. Remove from tcp Source; Add Binary Support to the http Source. The TCP source converts to String. This prevents binary transfers. Remove the transformer; if the user wants a String; (s)he can use (assuming the byte stream has valid UTF-8 encoding). Another option would be to add a option, but since conversion can already handle it, it's probably better to use that. On the other hand, a option would enable backwards compatibility. The http source also converts to String.. Allows looking at message headers without turning on debugging.. XD-1019 added simple (stateless) retry to the message bus. Use stateful retry and an enabling failed messages to be requeued on the broker until successful (perhaps because another instance can handle the message); also provides a mechanism to route failed messages to a dead-letter exchange. Requires setting the message id header in bus-generated messages. Also add profiles and properties for common retry backoff policies.. If the rabbit source receives a message it can't convert, a is thrown and the message is rejected (and requeued), causing an endless loop. Add an to the inbound adapter to detect and convert to . Also consider adding a retry interceptor to do the same for exceptions in modules (when using local transport).. Update to Spring AMQP. tx-size, concurrency etc.. For some reason, the partitioned batch jobs are storing s in the DB with a null ID. This causes to fail because the HATEOS code asserts not For some reason, the query for objects with the also returned these two objects with null keys. Blowing away my data directory fixes the problem (until I run another partitioned batch job). I need to figure out why spring batch is creating these bad records, but we should probably add some defensive code to protect against null IDs. You can reproduce by building against my XD-1146 branch.. Migrate to SI Redis Queue and Topic Adapters. When INT-3133 is resolved, SpEL s are inherited from parent contexts. Instead of adding the to each module's context, add it to the parent instead.. Move SpEL to Module Parent Context. and . references and is referenced by (and stopped).. Taps are currently source modules. They could be refactored to simply bridge the tapped module's tap pub sub topic directly (with conversion) to the first tap module's input channel. Note - ensure destroy works. Currently the tap is destroyed by the simple fact it is a module; if it's no longer a module we'll need special handling to stop remove the tap adapter.. Factor out common Redis Rabbit code. Also, factor out common inbound tap code (very similar). Change transport nternals to Use instead of and .. Revert XD-624 When SI is Available. When importing Spring-XD as a gradle project, in STS, while building the model, we get Root exception: Project location doesn't exist: . gradlew eclipse creates these directories, but the plugin needs them before running that task The problem seems to be that these ""projects"" are not really projects.

Change default container port from 9000 to something else. Add support for Hortonworks Data Platform. This will allow for some easy demonstration of how 'HATEOS' works via links in our REST API. There are probably some quite useful commands here that could be used from the Spring Data REST shell longer term, but a good place to take a look at now. Goal is to show how metrics such as counters are accessible w o having to switch tabs to use wget. The pretty printing of the returned JSON is an important feature to help understand the response, this functionality can be taken from reused from the Spring Data REST shell. This relates to XD-871 which provides a good scenario. stream create s1 ""http log stream create s2 ""http log The second command results in an error message that the port is in use but the stream definition is still saved. Since create + deploy is a logical unit of work, it should follow transactional semantics. In other words if the deploy fails, the repository should be rolled back (or a compensating destroy should be performed). Note this should not be handled the same way if create and deploy happen separately. In that case, the stream definition should remain.. Use a modal dialog to specify runtime parameters. There should be a little text are that gives hints as to the spring batch parameter key value conventions, for type. Might be a good idea to have a checkbox that lets you select to 'auto increment' job instance number. 4 columns key, value, type, identifying and an 'add parameter' button that adds a new row. This would appear as a modal dialog box, polling of the state of the deployments would be suspended while the job parameter modal dialog box is shown.. DataSource for batch infrastructure should be configurable, not hardcoded to hsqldb. Don't perform error-level logging for normal application behavior in batch admin functionality. UI: User should be able to filter the list of utions on the ution tab. On clicking a specific job name in the deployed jobs list, we need to redirect the user to show the list of all the job utions on that job.

Support writing to HDFS text file using the LZO codec. Support writing to HDFS text file using the BZip2Codec. Investigate throughput performance writing to HDFS. This could be an optimization, to be verified, that delegating the writing operations to Reactor with a backing ringbuffer will increase the throughput performance. Other strategies, such as threads to handle writes to individual files concurrently, should be investigated.. h2. Narrative As XD, I need a persistent way to register job definitions (beyond the map registry implementation provided by Spring Batch). h2. Acceptance Criteria XD should be able to register, unregister, and find job definitions via the registry. The registry should be backed by Redis so that it is persistent.. Create JobDefinition repository. Retrieve description of all registered modules. Add command for deleting a stream. Add command for listing streams. Type conversion and co-location of modules. When a module is deployed, it should run in its own isolated classpath. The current code has all dependencies in a single classpath, taken from the lib directory at startup. This has a number of drawbacks, one of the most important is the batch jobs can not be contributed to the system at runtime. The work for this epic is decoupled from any module deployment story. The assumption is that there will be a directory layout as shown below. Current layout And inside source Using an example of the source directory from the current the new layout would be We should support both the new and old layout styles There what is under 'file' directory is the 'package' No .zip, war, is required.. Deploying Custom Code. Modules (sinks, processors, sources) should be able to be easily tested inside the IDE using JUnit. Support various output format, Avro, SequenceFile, more advanced rollover options.. Add Twitter gardenhose source module. Add RabbitMQ source module. Add support to load a file in the source. Documentation for developing streams in the IDE needs to mention including scripts dir to project classpath. can make use of the system property inside an import statement. This determines which version of the XD infrastructure to load, for example what implementation, Local or Redis based, or specific message listener containers. File name conventions should be used, so if the option passed in from the command line is localChannel then the XML filename looked for has the 'Protocol' suffix applied, and is loaded via the classpath. Redis and Local will not be the only options, other will be provided in the future, Rabbit, and the user may be able to provide their own of these infrastructure classes (an advanced task).. Document how to create a custom input output module for existing SI channel adapters. Add more structure, more easily find the reference guide. The style that is here is nice..

Add gemfire-server application to the distribution zip of the project. Export of data from HDFS to MongoDB. Submit a brew-based install for Spring XD. The gradle application task should get us most of the way to create a distributable artifact akin to what you see when downloading tomcat jetty etc. Now there is a launch task task(launch, dependsOn: 'classes', type: JavaExec) The same main should be referenced in the application plugin, a task to create a .zip distributable is needed. Ideally would be nice to 1. download .zip 2. unzip 3. cd spring-xd bin 4. xdserver start and gracefully shutdown later with 5. xdserver stop I don't know if we can should bundle redis, I think we should bundle it.

The result of this is that we get a string that looks like this (when we convert the message to a String) Should be something like this (note the values below are for illustrative purposes only and should not be used as test data) h3. Root Cause Spring integration does not parse these messages. There is a JIRA for SI here:. ",2,215,1215

Starting teh shell without having admin running on results in the following message: Running gives a nasty stacktrace though, so these instructions are misleading and should be changed. Sqoop list-tables doesn't work oob. Add support for using Sqoop metastore. The hdfs sink doesn't recover after error writing to hdfs. Steps to reproduce - create a stream using hdfs sink with a small rollover: stop the datanode(s) and wait for an exception like: start the datanode(s) again, the sink never recovers and has to be undeployed and redeployed.. Update to SHDP for fixing hdfs store writer to recover after error writing to hdfs. As a build manager, I'd like to have Spring XD RPMs published in repository so that users can directly download the bits without having to go through appsuite repo or the EULA.. I'm running a jdbchdfs job with 8 partitions and 2 containers. Some steps complete ok while some (3-4 on average) fail with a connection pool error (see below). This happens with a decent size table rows). I tried two different databases - Oracle 11g on a separate server and MySQL running locally where the XD containers where running. Same pattern with both databases.. Frequent connection pool errors with jdbchdfs jobs. Create a Batch example to demonstrate JDBC- HDFS. Having problems testing against the Sandbox We need to set the following properties:. Make Sqoop job and MapReduce samples work with Hortonworks HDP single-node cluster. XD should use same hadoop security keys as Spring for Apache Hadoop. Add an ""xd-yarn info"" command to list admin servers and ports. As a user deploying XD on YARN I need a convenient way to get info like the admin port for my current deployment. Best way, for now, would be to add an info command to the xd-yarn script. With the latest changes the admin server runs on a random port when we deploy to YARN. In order for the user to connect they would have to query Zookeeper. This is inconvenient.. The Sqoop tasklet introduced an implementation in XD-2430. We are now adding similar support to Batch in BATCH-2329, BATCH-2330 and BATCH-2331. We should refactor Sqoop and Spark tasklets to use the as base.. Refactor Spark and Sqoop tasklets to use. Upgrade to Spring Boot. The jdbc sink is currently limited to handling the entire payload as a string and converting a single json object to row data. We should improve that and support the following input types: - (single row) - List (multiple rows as a batch insert) - JSON string (single row) - JSON array (multiple rows as a batch insert) - none of the above use The above matches what the new jdbc source puts out (depending on outputType used). Looks like the isn't used when compressing files with bzip2, some use cases requirer bz2 instead of bzip2 as the extension. Also, should be the default extension.

Clean up duplicated dependencies from XD on YARN installation. Going forward it seems that providing Hadoop v1 will be of lesser importance and we might as well drop it now. SHDP will also drop any v1 support. Remove support for: - hadoop12 - Apache Hadoop - cdh4 - Cloudera CDH - hdp13 - Hortonworks Data Platform Keep: - hadoop22 - Apache Hadoop (default) - phd1 - Pivotal HD - phd20 - Pivotal HD - cdh5 - Cloudera CDH - hdp21 - Hortonworks Data Platform This should make configuration and documentation easier too. Not to mention testing. This affects startup scripts and the shell plus the build script.. New job that utes SQL script using JDBC. Each Hadoop distro uses different settings for and we should provide some starting points for the distros we support running XD on YARN for. We should add a commented out stub entry for phd20, cdh5 and hdp21 to replace the one for hadoop22 when someone deploys on these distros.. We should add an easy way to configure the memory. Currently we only have the number of YARN containers configurable without diving into Spring YARN Boot specific config options. Proposing we do:. Not sure why the Hadoop classes are on the admin servers classpath. There is no way to select the distro, and the Hadoop classes shouldn't be needed except for module info for hdfs sink (see XD-1701). Add configuration for the partition strategy to HDFS sink to support writing files into subdirectories based on a partition key provided in the header or field in the message of the stream data. The writing using HDFS Store DataWriter should pass in the partition key value to be used for the write operation. Partition configuration could be made available to the sink using a parameter: that could then be used in XML config like: Similar to the time source.. When starting and stopping xd containers there are entries left in the directory that will cause 'runtime modules' command to fail. modules Command failed KeeperErrorCode NoNode for here the container is no longer running, but there is some data left over..

Sometimes getting NPE when master step runs for ftphdfs job. The Spring Data team recommends using the Jedis driver since the Lettuce driver hasn't had any update activity for several months. Jedis is actively maintained. We might also want to investigate Redisson which is a fork of Lettuce -. Add way to provide module config options for XD on YARN. There seems to be some intersection with the work for this issue and the of how module properties are handled. There will be changes to management support such that each module (source, sink, etc) will be able to also be overridden in (or wherever points to. The HDFS sink module for example, will have default values based on it's and will be of the form .. That means in the configuration for sink, there would be a config section such as With default values defined by a class. The module file would not contain any references to a properties file. A file specified by could override the values in a config section such as sink: hdfs: : : etc.. Add YARN specific code based on Janne's prototyping Add YARN Client and AppMaster and startup config files This includes shell scripts to deploy XD to YARN Test working on Apache distribution We can modify config files, everything should be possible to override by providing command-line args or env variables.. Add XD deployment for YARN. Rename avro sink to hdfs-dataset and add support for parquet format. Create EC2 AMI for single-node install of Cloudera CDH. hdfsjdbc throws an exception: The hdfsjdbc job uses 'columns' instead of 'names' as the parameter for the column-names. Should we make this usage consistent between jobs? There is a comment in the docs - ""there is also a limitation in that the database table must be created manually. This is due to a bug in Spring Hadoop and will be fixed in the Think this is this solved in Spring Hadoop now? should default to false now to be consistent with jdbc sink Rename to since these aren't just for import. filejdbc throws an exception: This can be solved by using a prefix Maybe just update the docs?. In the shell: job launch doesn't do completion of this is different behavior compared to job destroy typing 'job destroy' and hitting tab completes with ' typing 'job launch' and hitting tab does nothing. The batch jobs use different defaults compared to some of the sink source modules. filehdfs puts data in a data directory with files named after the stream using a .log file extension. The hdfs sink puts files in an xd directory using .txt as the default file extension. filehdfs needs a more descriptive naming. Align filehdfs batch job defaults with those of corresponding hdfs sink. Update to when it is released and remove the temporary in We should also review the supported hadoop distros - think we should support anything that is - hadoop12 - hadoop22 - phd1 (PHD - hdp13 - hdp20 - cdh4. The HDFS Sink should support writing POJOs to HDFS using Parquet. Support writing lines of text separated by a delimiter Support writing a CSV variables), TSV (tab-separated variables), No compression. We used to have a shared dependency in the lib dir. That's no longer there so hadoop distros that require this now fail (at least any hadoop based ones) We should also upgrade to current Hadoop versions (Hadoop stable). The HDFS Sink should support compressing files as they are copied. The HDFS Sink should support copying File payloads. We should support payloads in order to support non-textual file and large text file payloads being uploaded to HDFS. Currently text file payloads are converted to a text stream in memory and, non-String payloads are converted to JSON first, using an Ultimately we need to support streams such as ""file hdfs"" where the actually payload being copied to HDFS is not necessarily JSON or textual. Need to be able to support headers in the message that will indicate which HDFS file the data should be stored in.. We should adjust our options to the ones supported in the new - hadoop12 (default), cdh4, hdp13, phd1, hadoop20 This includes updating the wiki pages. Fix classpath error caused by multiple conflicting servlet-api jars. Create script to extract table data from JSON based on a given HAWQ table structure. The HDFS Sink should support writing POJOs to HDFS using Avro Serialization. The HDFS Sink should support a number of rollover options. The HDFS Sink should support a file naming strategy to distinguish between file currently being written and completed files. This is the basic setup of the commands file - no specific command implementations. ",83,2451,14062

Implement a Spark Streaming Receiver that binds to the MessageBus. Define interfaces for Spark Streaming modules. Currently I believe we only mention labels in this section of the doc: And it is not even clear there that they are when 2 or more module names would otherwise be ambiguous. It was probably written before we made that a mandatory part of the definition. We should mention this somewhere in the 'streams' section of the manual. Even if none of the examples there currently have more than one occurrence of the same module, we should add one to illustrate this point.. Composed Module currently behave as ""white boxes"". As soon as a module is composed (say ""http filter"") then all options of the children modules are available (as and in the example above). Change this so that a composed module is a black box: user has to explicitly expose an option for it to be available (most certainly using a short name). Hardcoding of values would be retained (and possibly overridable). Possible syntaxes : 1) 2) in case of ambiguity (simulated in this particular example): for specifying a default: 3) allow both 1) and 2), using 1) mainly for cases where we don't map 1 to 1 with the underlying option,.

The REST API for deploy should accept parameters, which provide manifest key value pairs Ultimately we will want to support passing a named manifest which had been stored previously. The 'stream deploy' shell command should support passing these as Initially we should support .instances and .group.. Also likely rename, remove, or replace that Module (maybe can be supplanted by when used in the refactored parser). Also, considering the ""url"" property is not necessary (vestige of the prototype), all we'd be left with here is the Module name and type, which are used to identify a Module uniquely. Therefore this Module could be renamed to ModuleKey or something. It could be used within the itself. The two classes in question are: The former is currently used by the Admin when making decisions about Module deployment. That latter was a replacement for as we migrated the various Redis InMemory Repositories to use the data that is now available in ZooKeeper instead. The is currently used by the Admin leader, and the is used by the REST endpoint that supports the xd-shell's 'runtime containers' command. Perhaps those can also be merged. In any case, if not addressed by a larger refactoring, the should probably support an Iterable return rather than an Iterator.

Validate time field processing with. The Admin leader will write each Module deployment request to a child node of for a selected Container (see XD-1399). That (persistent) child node needs to be created by the Container at the same time as it creates its ephemeral node under The Container should then deploy the Module. If that same node is subsequently deleted, the Container should undeploy the Module.. The Stream deployment requests will be written to and the data on that node will include the state or a boolean indicator (for now) of whether it should be deployed. When a Stream is deployed, the leader will consult its Container cache and write the modules to the various child nodes (see XD-1400).. This should also enable removal of any code. The state should be written as a data node at the stream level ) For now we at least need to support the boolean flag. If that is true, then the leader Admin will deploy the modules of the stream across available containers (XD-1399). Admin leader should watch Container nodes in ZooKeeper. The xd containers node is the parent where each Container will write an ephemeral child node. The node name should be the Container's ID, and the node data should be the Container's attributes (host, pid, and much more to be added later). When a Container shuts down cleanly, it should eagerly delete the ephemeral node so that watchers are notified immediately. For any other case (including a network partition), the ephemeral node will disappear after the timeout elapses.. Rename or reconsider the command. With PR 340, listing of runtime modules with a non-existent containerId will display empty table.

When deploying a batch job, the UI displays the database password found in the in plain text to the user. At the very least, this should be displayed in a password field so it's masked out and have it masked out in the resulting definition at the bottom of the page. Ideally, we wouldn't provide the password on that page at all and only accept overriding options (if the user wants a password other than the configured one, enter itotherwise, we'll use what we have).

Replace with generic SI Components. Make requirement for MD5 hash files configurable for the custom module registry.

Class and package rename is TBD.. This addresses The plugin issue to disable. Fail fast on Kryo registration conflicts. TupleCode should retain custom formatting settings. Refactor MessageBus to avoid unnecessary use of MessageBuilder. As a developer, I'd like to refactor the programmatic means by which the MessageBus transforms the Message so throughput performance can be optimized.. SCS - Verify Fix implementation. Accept any file name for top level module resources. Expecting in module configuration is brittle, especially in conjunction with module upload command which permits the module to be registered under a different name. The convention should be dropped in favor of any file name. This requires at most one and or in the top level config folder. It is an exception if multiples are found. Accepting any file name provides the most flexibility without sacrificing backward compatibility (except in rare cases in which a module developer may have violated the multiple xml or properties files condition). An alternate approach requiring a well known file name such as were rejected over concerns that it would break any existing custom module. Upgrade to Boot RELEASE and the dependencies. Add support for common dependent jars for modules. ModuleFactory is responsible for determining how the Module application context is created from available sources at the resource location exposed via the The factory creates the application context and creates a SimpleModule or as For example, if an XML file is present, it is assumed to be the bean definition file used to create a CXMLAC.

Currently the message bus is only obtained via Stream testing scenarios that depend on sending and receiving payloads via named channels do not require a deployed module instance per se, but any stream flow control uses the MessageBus directly. Getting a deployed module instance in general is expensive, you have to wait for the module to deploy whereas the MessageBus implementation could be known a priori when the application starts. An improvement would be to ask the container for its MessageBus.. Change the default port since it conflicts with the default port for the http source. Investigate Swagger to generate REST API Documents. Enhance the stream parser to take message conversion into account in order to validate or automatically configure converters.

Remove Spark Hadoop dependencies from root classpath. Scala processor module utor trims messages. The spark streaming message bus receiver isn't reliable yet.

Redis sink: better handling of module activation. pointing to the complete directory structure is needed only for the modules that share common properties (rabbit, jdbc, twitter). otherwise, any other module properties require syntax.

So with our Dynamic Content Type Manager we have a pagination built into and set at 5 items per page. This is OK if you're only using 5 - 10 Content Data Types or Templates When you start have dozens, like 15 or more, this means you could be left clicking 3 or more times to find a Content Data Type or Template. Could we not add a page drop down as we have in Event Viewer, File Manager, etc?

As I move my cursor over a row in the list, I should see icons for the item which allows me to edit or delete a given Content Type. Above the Content Type list, there should be a button for creating a new content type. The Content Type List should show a pager control if the list grows beyond 10 items. h2. Conversation h2. Confirmation. h2. Card As an administrator, I want to have a single module that allows me to manage and edit Dynamic Content Types and the associated data types, validators and templates. h2. Conversation The module should be built using the new SPA module type. This module will be a showcase for how to leverage the new SPA module type in DNN 8. This module could be added to any page but should have a page in the admin menu by default. Anyone with View permissions on the module should be able use the module. h2. Confirmation All buttons in the DCC should be rendered as links with appropriate styling to display them as buttons where desired.. h2. Card As a developer, I want to create a Settings view for my SPA module. The Settings view should be displayed as a tab on the module settings page and should otherwise operate exactly like the settings page for Web Forms based modules. h2. Conversation h2.

Conversation h2. Confirmation. h2. Card As a developer, I want to be able to use Anti-forgery tokens with my MVC module. The HTML helper should be modified to work in the DNN framework. The developer should be able to decorate their action methods with the appropriate attribute and have it correctly validate the token. h2. Conversation There is no requirement to support the obsoleted overloads of the helper or attribute. h2. Confirmation. h2. Card As a developer, I would like to have access to a set of common datatypes with a new DNN installation. Common DataTypes should include: Text Time Boolean File Url Markdown h2. Conversation We may not need RichText or Markdown. We also might not want to breakdown the datetime. h2. Confirmation These types cannot be deleted or updated.. h2. Card As a developer, I want to call an API to allow me to Create, Read, Update or Delete ContentTypes. ContentTypes which are created and managed by the DCC should be differentiated from ContentTypes which were created outside of the DCC. A contenttype is just a collection of contentfields. It does not define anything related to how the content might be presented or where content might be stored. It is purely a container. h2. Conversation It is important for the DCC to not get confused by existing ContentTypes which may not conform to the new DCC system. Are contenttypes defined for a portal or a host? h2. Confirmation ContentTypes are defined per portal.. The allows the developer to define a method which will be called to retrieve a collection of module actions. Additional error handling logic should be added to ensure that null reference exceptions don't occur if the method is not properly defined. If the expected method does not exist, then a should be thrown which includes a message indicating the full type and method name that was not implemented. See line 81 of the for a case where a null reference exception may occur.. h2. Card As part of our move to more web service based development, we would like to open up the ability to call platform services from external systems in a secure manner. The simplest approach is to use an HMAC based signature which can be used for both HTTP and HTTPS connections. A custom authorization attribute should be created which implements the HMAC protocol for authorization. h2. Conversation We will not consider using the same API for both internal and external access. h2. Confirmation. SPIKE - Investigate HMAC based authorization for Web Services. Create custom JavaScript HTML tokens. h2. Card As part of MVC support the solution should support the use of standard Action Filters. This is a spike to determine the level of effort needed to implement this feature. h2. Conversation DNN must support the following Action Filters Action - used to provide custom code before and after the ution of the action Exception - used to provide exception handling within an Action h2. Confirmation. h2. Card The MVC framework uses HTML helpers to simplify rendering of common HTML elements. Modules written using the MVC framework should be able to utilize all core HTML helpers including: h3. Form Helpers TextBox() RadioButton() DropDownList() Password() h3. Validation Helpers ActionLink h2. Conversation Should add URL and AJAX helpers h2. Confirmation. If we are going to include services, then we just include services. I don't like the idea of including a ""web method"" which will soon be obsolete. Instead we should add a web service which would be of more value than a web method.. h3. CARD As a user, I want to see the getting started content in the same language as my website. h3. CONVERSATION We do not want to maintain multiple versions of the formatted html (having the html doc in multiple languages is not desired). Which culture should be used? h3. CONFIRMATION If the user language is in an unsupported language, then we should fall back to English Localization should use the to be consistent with static localization.. h3. CARD As a user I want to see content that is specific to my DNN product and product version. h3. CONVERSATION h3.

This, however, is not being picked up by the site creation as part of the import process.

Card As a developer, I want the content I create using the DCC API to get automatically indexed for later searching. The indexer should only index the actual field values and should not pick up any of the field names. Given values are all stored in Json format, it is not easy to sort filter paginate through database calls. For example, we have a content type: Employee and we want to sort on First Name. The current APIs won't be able to do that as values are stored in Json. We are going to use Search APIs to perform sort filter pagination based on data in Lucene. This requires that we provide the correct names for the various fields in Search. h2. Conversation h2. Confirmation. EVOQCONTENT: Uploading ANY file through Database Folder Provider fails. EVOQSOCIAL: Cloud - iUpgradable problem causes content in various modules to not work. EVOQCONTENT: Introduce ContentItem for Folders.

Currently the UserSearch in DNN does not index Username or Email address. We should capture that so they can be searched upon. They should both by default be restricted to Admins or the Users him her self only. We should also try to enhance the current logic where everything is being dumped in instead we should use custom keywords so at the time of querying structured data can be retrieved. There are few dates that can also be added in the SearchDocument Date User was created). This information can be used when someone uses the SearchAPIs to perform custom queries and sorting.. displayed in Journal Module.. AUTO: The page deleted with an error. SI Search Exception Related to URL. We have number of parameters in both the SearchDocument and SearchQuery objects (such as ModuleId, ModuleDefId, TabId, However, we don't have GroupId. In a environment, modules usually have just one instance of themselve, but the data has additional property of GroupId to segmenet them from one group to the other. Usually groupId is upplied via query string parameter. Lack of groupid in these objects causes items to be searchable from all the groups. Note: The groupid should be saved or searched only when it's 0 (have a look at code around in method) Unit tests must be written (copy paste change from others). The Console module should use a copy on all pages (except the main Activity Stream one) so it is easier to change settings across multiple instances. Note: We will not handle upgrade scenarios for this because it is too invasive. Testing Notes: - Login as an admin or super user. - Go to your profile page (the one w the Activity Stream journal on it) - Edit the module settings for the console module, change it to show small icons - Go to any other page shown there (friends, messages, my profile) and verify it shows the icon on all those pages - Admin page also uses console module - it's setting should not be changed,.

Confirmation Note for DEV: please ensure that we remove anything related to that feature and we do not leave any dead code in the source.. Remove Advanced Settings. The current format of the Content Item is in json and for a type like Product (see below): Product Description (string) Picture (integer) Is in the following format: This format is currently over complex the structure of the json and could be simplified with a more natural and intuitive format (similar of what MongoDB use as well): The proposed format: save spaces in the database it is easier to read Note: the content type Id is also probably no required as this information is already stored in the Content Item table: Note for DEV: we should carefully review if this new proposed format fits with any needs of the DCC: Lists *. DCC API - Simplify Dynamic Content Item json format. Currently all the logic to delete or add a template is in the Web Methods of the DCC Admin Module. See Delete Template Save Template Note: Similar code is duplicated in the Business Controller of the Admin module to create the default templates. We should move this code down into the API level class) as this is something that the API should be able to manage, so third party or other component do not need to care about templates files logic and any operation using the API is atomic and consistent. As part of this task we will need to write: * Unit and if needed and possible Integration Tests. Quick Settings Implement as a JQuery plugin. DCC - Error creating new content field with invalid field type.. The goal of this task is perform an architectural review of DCC Architecture. : Ensure proper indexes are in place Ensure system will not create overly large tables, thus requiring lots of disk space Queries are efficient and combined together : We have decent caching so that we are not hitting database for every page load (anonymous and registered users both) Ensure client side JS is optimal. In case of detection of any issues a new jiras will be created and link to this task.. DCC - Architectural Review. DCC - Possible dead loop in content types definition. EVOQCONTENT - Auto hit the site again during installation makes the IUpgradable runs in parallel with portal 0 creation. Auto hit the site again during installation makes the IUpgradable runs in parallel with portal 0 creation. Open a new browser tab while the install is in process Actual result The IUpgradable runs in parallel with the portal creation process making the result of the installation unpredictable or even broken. * The installation process should prevent this managing any other request to the site and run IUpgradable only once the installation + portal creation end properly. Note: this is an issue that likely exists since (when the code base was moved to github) or even before.. Remove ContentList Module. EVOQCONTENT - Password UI issues. EVOQCONTENT - DAM: UNC folder provider - folder remains in DAM after it was deleted in the remote server. EVOQCONTENT - Site search not working for tags with html characters. EVOQCONTENT - Sync Knockout javascript library version stored under. EVOQCONTENT - Do not start Workflow in AddTab Method. Module Actions - add support to identify in the DOM the module actions menu items. In Platform the module actions in Edit Mode are generated as a list. Currently there is not an elegant way to identify menu item in the DOM like: Import Help Today we can only identify the Delete module action as it has an ID that looks like: + MODULEID + ""-Delete"". The proposal is extend this mechanism to: Settings, Import, Export and Help.. EVOQCONTENT - Page Versioning Negative ContentItemId errors. EVOQCONTENT - Content Layout: ModuleAction js error when moving Layout position in a pane. EVOQCONTENT - Move modules doesn't work correctly when have deleted modules. EVOQCONTENT - Admin Page Management doesn't work properly. EVOQCONTENT - Recycle Bin Restore Tab does not work. Module Online Help button should not visible if the module manifest does not specify a helpUrl. Install a module that have the view module control with an empty tag put the module on the page enter in edit mode expand the module actions and click on Help check the content of the dialog The dialog shows a ""Help Online"" button that does not work, when the user clicks on it nothing happens. The system should not show this button and or provide a message that online help is not available for this module. EVOQCONTENT - Page Versions Rollback can be done in the backend for the last page version. Add a service to that allows to delete (soft) a module included in one tab. Note: this web method should be only available to Admin Host and created for integration testing purposes.. EVOQCONTENT - Add a method to allow to delete (soft) modules. EVOQCONTENT - Add Page missing events in Platform. h2. Card: Site Settings extension point code references to DigitalAssets Module. This should be something more generic as other module could inject some extensions. The module name used in the extension point metadata should be. UI UX review performed. It looks good.. Currently some of the web methods return a 200 http response with an empty body on success. This has issue when jQuery ajax calls are performed with as the empty response is handled as an error (empty response is an invalid json). The will fix this changing the empty success response with. The utils class works with private STATIC imgWidth and imgHeight members. These two fields should be removed and created as method variables. Statics members have issues in concurrency scenario. The profile picture thumbnails are created when requested if they have not been generated previously or if they have been removed (see for further details). If the user loads a page with a lot of user profile pictures of the same user Journal in the Profile Page) we can run into concurrency issues and the images can be created with an incorrect width or height..

If I leave this setting as ""None Specified"" then when the user goes to the login page without a return url query string, then the user is directed back to the login page and they think they are not logged in. I think a better design is to be able to set this so that 2 doesn't happen, but it should check to see if there is a return url in the query string. If there is, then it should ignore this setting..

When validating the user's credentials for the JIRA login, clicking Validate behaves a little odd: the Validate button stays blue, and then a couple seconds later we get a beach ball. Also, the error message when it fails is a little obtuse since it shows the exception name - we can probably handle the specific case of bad credentials with a custom message? * Once we've validated the user's information, we should remove the field.

Ideally, the live view allows users to click or select some piece of code and see the AST (or it could just be the AST of the whole document as an outline). Additionally, the user could type in a rule in the form expected by the validation engine, and see the resultant matching nodes in the tree or the document.. FTP: Changing file permissions in properties window does not change the permissions on the server. When browsing on a remote ftp server, changing file permissions in the file properties window does not ute a chmod command in the ftp console and does not make changes on the server.

Suggested fix: Attempt to replicate If it's an issue with our code, apply fix If it's a jRuby issue, link ticket to upstream item and place this ticket on hold.. We use a lock on the entire repo. We should have a separate lock for the config file, since most of the ""writes"" won't affect it.. Cannot format jQuery. See comments for code. The quick outline requires wildcards to search for items, whereas the outline filter does not. Please see the screenshot for an example.. Quick outline filter requires use of wildcards when searching. If a user edits the filters on a participant or modifies enablement, we need to force a clean rebuild of projects for the changes to take effect. Like JDT, we should warn the user of needing to rebuild all projects (and offer to cancel). Also, we don't need to do this if only changing reconcile options.. Set the built-in web server to use the computer's IP address Applying and restarting Aptana. Reboot your mac and open Aptana again Go run a html file as a JavaScript web application. The web server is bound to instead of the computer's IP address. Going in to change it to the computer's IP address shows that it is still set. Changing it back to clicking apply and then changing it back to the computer's IP address, applying and restarting Aptana resolves the issue temporarily.. There are an extra two blank lines in the text hover documentation. Open a new JS file Type ""var x new Array();"" Place the cursor before ""var"" and type "" **"" + Enter You will get an extra line:. Unable to create project in location with pre-existing files. If you create a new project (in my case PHP) and you point to a location which already contains files, Aptana won't allow you to create the project. You see a warning, but there is no way to skip this warning and create the project regardless.. Steps as listed here: File New File will create a new file. This will not respond to ""Undo"" (see Eclipse bug where they fixed that) To replicate: Eclipse (JDT): Navigator, but not Package Explorer or Project Explorer Titanium Studio (dev): App Explorer and Project Explorer Titanium Studio App Explorer and Project Explorer Open a file in the Editor. undo history.. Given a project with a very large html file (attached), I wanted to create new file (php). Doing so blocked Studio for 15 minutes while indexing was in progress and no way to cancel it unless I killed the application. The indexed file is not even on the same project. Indexing should not interrupt file creation.. Add Ruby documentation hovers for variables, types and methods. Add HTML documentation hovers for elements and attributes. See - description Remarks remarks Example example Specification. Investigate FTP directory failing issue to see if it's still a problem. Pre-select last used connection in connection menu drop down for repeated synchronization. I would prefer remembering of the last connection used for I have some projects deployed to more than one place (connection). When I make some little changes in the project (for example in template), it usualy relates to one specific connection. As soon as I check changes, I synchronize files with that connection. Now, whats wrong. In serie of more changes in a row, everytime I want to synchronize, I need to switch to the right connection prior to the actual because Aptana not remember last used connection. There is checkbox ""Remember my decision"" but it's unusable for my situation. I still need dialogue for selection of connection.. Add option to format object properties on separate lines. When trying to format this bit of JavaScript code, the formatter used to crash: Now, it just collapses all of the properties onto a single line. * Add UI and functionality into the formatter, allowing the properties to be formatted each to one line..

Attached PHP file has the code that fails plus the error code Code:. PHP: Unable to format string with interleaved comments. PHP: Keep end ? on same line as previous. I badly write in English, I will write an example Aptana: Netbeans:. We have a couple classes that handle sniffing document type and then returning info on HTML tags being tags being forbidden. They're in HTMLParseState and We use this in our CA and parsing and would like to use it in Validation as well. Ideally this sort of information seems like it should be in the XMl metadata for HTML, rather than in a supporting utility class or two. New model elements Replace calls from HTMLParseState. Outline appears broken. Broken Linux links on. On the website the x64-linux links are broken for Aptana Studio.. Paste the following into a new HTML file, inside a project: Note there is an error in the gutter around alertMsg , but not in the problems view Save the file. Note, no change in the problems view Right-click on the project, and choose ""Build"" Note the problems view now contains a corresponding error. During the Aptana Studio and Titanium Studio build process, we need to create a set of JavaDocs to make it easier for end users to navigate and understand. This ideally is placed into a ""javadocs"" folder in this area so that they can be uploaded as part of the nightly sync. There should be some set of ANT tasks we can use to generate the docs. We also need to replace the default stylesheet with the JBoss one:. A number of items are written out to the log under the INFO level. However, if you have the slider set to ALL, that can provide an astronomical amount of data, particularly from the scripting plugin, assuming you have not selected particular components to debug. Add Only show ""trace"" items if level is set to and you have chosen to debug the specific component in question. This is in contrast to the current behavior for INFO where it will show all components if no specific one is selected.. Studio infers wrong remote path after using both ""Go Into"" and having FTP time out. APSTUD-4069 is solved, however invoking the commands listed in APSTUD-4069 results in Scripting Console errors. Steps to Replicate : 1) Open Aptana Studio 2) Open a CoffeeScript file 3) Select Commands CoffeeScript Insert Heredoc """""" Comment, Commands CoffeeScript Insert Heredoc """""" Quotes or Commands CoffeeScript Insert Heredoc ''' Quotes Actual Results : The Scripting Console will show the message : line 3: column number: command not found line 4: syntax error near unexpected token `(' line 4: `whitespace "" "" Convert 8 commands to inline Ruby, 7 of which are easy and 1 which is complicated. Git not using and from .gitconfig. I noticed that when I do a commit using the gui (specifically the Commit command in the App Explorer gear menu), git isn't using the and from the .gitconfig in my home directory. I'm running the Studio 3 Beta plugin in Galileo on Windows XP, and I'm using msysgit When I do the same commit from the git bash prompt, it works fine. Is there a separate global git config for Studio 3? Is there an easy way to sync this with the .gitconfig in my home directory?. HTML content is indexed in web projects. The information store there should be included in the Index View under a separate top-level HTML node. Content provider and label provider for HTML Query index for content * Some icons. Improve additional information popup for JavaScript. Improve additional information popup for CSS. Improve additional information popup for HTML. Amend the current hover tooltip to add a link the HTML documentation for the specified item (if available). For core HTML, JavaScript and CSS functionality where the documentation is provided by standard metadata files, the URL can be constructed to point to In-Studio help. See Studio 2 for an example of this: For other elements (like Titanium properties) perhaps there is a mechanism by which we can provide a custom resolver to generate the URL. It could also be that this might be provided by an extension point or class property when the contribution happens. See for details.. Add icon to ""Open HTML docs"" for current content assist entry for JS language. JavaScript Core Reference HTML DOM 2 Reference * Titanium Mobile Reference (if applicable) Hover and Dynamic help for functions is identical to properties, except it shows the method signature. See for information on how to contribute dynamic help. See and for the majority of the including both the top content, and the list of resources at the bottom. Suggest we try running any JS code blocks through the formatter.. Create redirects for the most common studio pages * Updating links in our current project. Right now we index the full gems installation, which can take a little bit of time if the user has a lot of gems. It also impacts lookup since they're all stored in the same index. Ideally each gem (and version) would be it's own index and would get associated with ruby projects based on Gemfile (or other files' gem requires). Parse the gem file to find the gem versions and names Content assist only on gems used * Listen to changes to gem file to update index. The diff view is not readable with the default color theme. The black bars on the black background have zero contrast with each other.. PHP: Show functions inside conditionals in Outline view. Currently it is not possible to view functions defined inside a conditional in the outline view. They appear to be ignored. without if () it works:. There is no ""length"" property in jQuery content assist. There is no ""length"" on list, though it exists in the API: There may be similar items that are missing.. Theme export not escaping certain characters, creating an invalid theme file. I exported a theme to a file, reinstall an Aptana Studio, but when I try import it, nothing happened.. JavaScript: Instance method in SDOCML file missing in content assist. Create a new SDOCML file in a web project Paste in the following: Save this file and open a new JavaScript file. Type clearCache is missing from the proposals list. When using code folding in a PHP document if the editor find an error in my code it unfold all folded block of codes (functions, Paste the following into a document: Fold both functions Select ""public"" at the beginning of one of the functions and replace it with the letter ""p"". This will force an error in the document. Both functions unfold.. Syntax errors don't appear in ruler until after save with Build Participation.. The last line in a file is not clickable. Aptana Studio initially opens files significantly slower than Studio. JavaScript content assist not automatic from between contiguous braces. HTML Editor Matches Double Quotes In Text Areas, Strings and comments. : the HTML editor auto-matches double-quotes in the text area. Steps to Replicate : 1) Open Aptana Studio 2) Open an HTML file 3) Enter a double-quote between the body tags Actual Results : The editor will auto-match the double-quote. Expected Results : The HTML editor is not supposed to auto-match single or double-quotes in text, strings, or comments. XML matching tag highlighting fails. XML outline does not clear upon replacing current content with erroneous content. Move Eclipse base for Studio to and remove support for Eclipse. Find Bar in split-screen editors copies text from wrong editor. Ship PHP, Ruby and Python features separately from Studio. Add ""Connection link to Remote View menu. Ability to control the auto closing of quotes and brackets separately. When I use and in JS editor content between them is still formatted. Testcase: original code when formatted, all items in array are merged into one line. When creating a wizard, we manually composite a foreground image onto a background image, but this is an intensive process. Instead, create a utility class that a supplied top image against a standard background image on demand. Thus, if a person wants to create a new wizard image, they need not manually have to do so. It will center the top image (horizontally and vertically) on the bottom image. Aptana freezes when opening a folder while a file is being created inside it. It's the secound time that my Aptana freezes (and locks the complete OS) when i am opening a folder in the App Explorer while a file is created in the folder I'm try to open. I was able to get my system back via switching to a new shell (STRG + ALT + F1) and killing the Java pid.. PHP: Add hyphened variables to double click selection delimiters. When you double click on something like depending on where you click, Aptana will select text. If you click to foo, Aptana will select ""$foo"", if you click on ""bar"" or ""baz"" Aptana will select only that text, without dash or period. You can see Aptana and Notepad++ comparison in the attachment. Someone suggested it a while ago in We have determined that we should be supporting the addition of the hyphened text -bar, in this example). Remove Firefox installation requirement on Studio startup and instead show prompt on Firefox debug launch. Currently, we prompt the user for an install of Firefox if we can't find it at startup. We should instead do the check and install if they've chosen to debug with Firefox.. ScriptDoc Autocomplete for JavaScript functions. Investigate replacement for HTML Tidy Validator. Steps to reproduce: Copy into a new Web project Open up the file Turn on ""Mark Occurrences"" Click on the first instance of ""function"" note that the annotations in the side bar come up quite quickly, but profiling, it shows a significant performance hit in At this point the IDE is unusable for quite some time (10-30 seconds) See screenshots for details. I noticed that if I only allowed 100 annotations to be created, performance seemed acceptable (though still kinda slow). Set ""Mark Occurrences"" as ""off"" by default. JavaScript Window Object Content Assist Missing some height, offset and screen properties, and createPopup method. JavaScript Document Object Content Assist missing documentMode,. Exclude files from the deploy tools using paths rather than by file types. Currently there is only an option to cloak file types from the deployment assistent. But very often it's not only file types with sould be excludet. For an example. I have a PHP project remote and local, i have for example local other usernames and passwords for the database connection. So i have to skip on every deployment the or i would kill the live system. Currently there is no way, because cloaking is not realy an option. I think a textfield where i can store the complete path would be very useful. The syntax could be like in an .gitignore file.. Frequent and Random Aptana crashes. i get multiple crashes from Aptana and I notice it regularly occurs when I am switching back to it (eg. apple-tab) from another app like Chrome. It's happened to me several times today. here is the apple problem reporter info after the app crashed: See attached file for full information. Suggestions to investigate: Does it matter if the internal browser is disabled Perhaps this will dissipate with Eclipse (now built on top of Eclipse. Ubuntu: Aptana won't save editor tab sizes. PHP: Context Information fails when there is a string in the parameter list. PHP No code assist on methods. In some context locations, the code assist may pop-up automatically to suggest available options. For example, an available list of functions, variables and constants will appear after typing a PHP arrow string '- '. Call other class methods do not work. there was no code assist when used like this. Assume the following snippet: If you type d+TAB, it inserts: If instead, you menu it will insert: Expected is:. Create sub-folder under temp for our temporary files. If i work with a lot of FTP connections, after some hours my tmp directory is getting very nasty. If you have some other tools that work directly in tmp, you don't find your own files anymore. (see the screenshot) I think it would be a very nice feature if i could determain a custom path for this files. Normaly on Linux you have . You can see other tools like pulse, orbit, ssh, always using their own subdirectory.. If you have methods with long parameter descriptions, sometimes the auto complete popup it very hard to read, as shown in the attached screenshot (the code is from the Zend Framework). The content should wrap according to the width of the popup (it appears to break early here). Content assist content wraps short of popup edge. PDT WST editors are not available in an Aptana PHP project. Set ""Project Natures"" to PHP WEB ""Others"" menu. Show better error messages when invoking a command without the proper Ruby gem Installed. PHP: Add Open Type Method PHP feature. One feature that is sorely missed is Open Type in the Eclipse PHP PDT. Attached is a screenshot of the feature in Eclipse PDT.. Word Wrap shows keybinding conflict when used as plugin in Eclipse for Java EE. It appears some users are upset by the creation of an empty Aptana Rubles folder in on startup. Given that user rubles can now be created directly in-workspace as top-level projects, the current Aptana Rubles location may be antiquated, as users will rarely have to interact with the folder directly. Viewing here: It suggests that a possible better location would be under the Alternately, we could only create the Aptana Rubles folder if a user chooses to actually download and install new Rubles.. Support for ""requires"" and imported modules * Auto-attaching of documentation sources (see for an example of possible workflow. We ran into an issue with PATH holding cygwin paths on Windows breaking git clones. I added a method to convert between the two, but we need to make sure we convert anywhere we're not uting inside the Terminal bash.. Aptana 2 has great feature for JavaScript formatting: ""auto format code block when typing closing brace ' '"". This setting accessible in Aptana 2 from: Window - Preferences - Aptana - Editors - JavaScript - Typing - Formatting It would be nice if such feature will be presented in Aptana 3 Attached screenshot of the preferences screen in Aptana 2 and another screenshot showing formatting behavior. h3. Suggested solution Add preference (off by default) for this setting Find relevant nodes in the AST into selection and perform format Add lots of unit tests. Our current unit test coverage hovers around 30% (class, method, block, and line) We need to get this higher. Here are the classes we need to test: Please create a sub-task for the class you want to test, and edit the document to indicate you've claimed that test. If there already is a task created for a particular class, it means someone else has claimed that one, so choose another. If there are a bunch of related classes, you can group that into one task. Coverage goals for all classes below is a minimum of 100% class, 70% method, 80% block, 80% line (default Emma values in Jenkins) URIUtil. The default PMD profile is too strict for our purposes. Create a default PMD profile all developers can use to validate code correctness before checkin. Please create a profile, run it against some of our current source code to see if it reports what is expected, and pass it around to the other developers for confirmation.. The default FindBugs profile is too strict for our current code base. We need to create a more limited profile that we can use to validate all committed code for possible errors. Please create a profile, run it against some of our current source code to see if it reports what is expected, and pass it around to the other developers for confirmation.. intermittently fails in editor. Mac OS X Lion has a full screen feature for a lot of native apps. It would be great for Aptana to have a feature like this.. Implement a new JavaScript validation framework. We have multiple different validators for JS. They are inefficient, out of date, and nearly Propose creating an infrastructure to replace this with a single way of defining rules. Brief requirements: Should encapsulate these rules ( It should allow for style usage validation for things like Titanium Mobile projects. This kind of validation might only happen in JS files in Titanium Mobile projects It should allow for cross-file validation. Ideally, those rules exist in some form that can be modified and converted into our new format.. ""New From Template"" should list all possible file types, and provide a template option for each. Add XML parse-level validation. Expand Collapse icons in Project Explorer drawn with 1px borders. Add F2 support for Content Assist Hover. F2 should pop up the content assist tooltip, or if hovering over content, F2 will provide focus.. Implement improved terminal hyperlink detection. On terminal windows with a long history of output (a couple pages), scrolling up with the mouse wheel will jump back down once it reaches a certain point. However, if you manually drag the scroll bar up, you can see history beyond the jumping point. I've seen this reproducible on Allen's machine when you tail rails logs. You can see similar symptoms in the attached movie. A short investigation showed that the issue relates to the implementation of hyperlink detection in Terminal. Disabling hyperlink detection eliminates the issue. Suggested fix: Re-implement hyperlink detection code to make it free of issues.. From the current system: template ""Custom Template"" do t "" .html"" end By default this WOULD DO environment substitution. Also add a setting to allow turning on off parameter substitution (identical to project templates). Menus aren't visible in Ubuntu Unity window manager. Aptana doesn't show the menu bar in Unity window manager on Ubuntu. When editing HTML, CSS and Javascript files, the non-selected entries in the code completion widget are all white (see attached screenshot). The colors stay the same regardless of the Gnome theme selected. The colors of the tooltip correctly matches the system colors, but code completion is always displayed like this. When opening a file in a non-aptana editor, the code completion widget correctly matches the color of the tooltip. I run Ubuntu and Aptana Studio. No file system is defined for scheme. There's still no multi line Now I know there's the DRY principle that any good coder should utilize. But there's just tons of situations where it's needed. Like where the DRY principle is practically not applicable. Also searching other's code for a specific line is much easier if you can just paste a chunk of code into the search bar. You know - tutorials - that some of us have to do to stay on top. In the meantime, you'll have to use regular expressions (use R for carriage returns). Longer-term, suggest modifying the find bar to allow for a ""multi-line"" option. Proposed spec:. Updating to latest RCP on dev installs JDT plugins. PHP: Error updating PHP error markers. Add ability to to select word via camel case. In my old Aptana2 + PDT the camelCaseWord. In the current version the whole word in selected. Is it possible to change this behaviour somehow (maybe with an option)?. Find dialog cause text selection to ""invert"" colors. This is what happens: I select some text - I open the find replace dialog (I press CTRL+F then click on the magnifier icon in the search bar) At this point the selection is gone (like it is ""inverted"" or something similar), so the option to find replace only in selected line is useless. I'm on the latest build (win7) and never experienced this before. The error log is clean.. Eclipse PDT provides the option to have trailing whitespace automatically removed from files on save from the end of a line where it has no impact). Is it possible you could add this useful feature?. Project Explorer is showing duplicate files and folders. In the attached image, Project you can see the current improper behavior. In attached image, C-C++ you can see the expected behavior. The view is proper in Project Explorer for Web Projects. This is with a new install of Eclipse Helios CDT and Aptana Studio 3 on Arch Linux. This also appears in a few other circumstances (see linked issues).. This is something that was shipped with (skipped out on so don't know if it's there). Don't know if this is planned for (on the product page I've seen that JS debugging is coming soon), yet it would be great if this were to be found into Aptana again (same goes for the ability to run a script through the PHP parser to get the output). I've found the debugger to be one of the main Aptana features I use during my lectures (I'm a lecturer at a technical university), helping the students to understand what's going on on ""the inside"" of a PHP process.. Trying to get started with Aptana Studio Debugger on a standalone install of Aptana Studio (Mac OS X - Intel). Following online help: ""This walkthrough will instruct you how to install the Aptana JavaScript debugger, add a breakpoint to your code, and display the current values of your variables. 1. Import the debugging sample as a project. In the Samples View, expand the Aptana Studio Samples node. But in the Samples View I don't have the specified node, I only have samples related to plugins I have installed. Where do I get the Aptana Studio Samples node ?. Aptana Studio does not ship with debugger sample. Given this pattern: Aptana Studio is not able to recognise this pattern correctly. I wonder if it's possible to tell Aptana with ScriptDoc. If yes, how? I've only seen comments for classes. Additionally var self ; could be replaced by a super constructor, which is not working either. Can I expect this to be supported naturally by Aptana soon? I'm really searching for a good javascript IDE which also supports this kind of writing javascript in a way.. singleton scriptdoc code completion. Dragging an image into the HTML editor should create an image tag. Dragging an image into the editor should create a img tag. You can view this behavior in TextMate. Dropping an image onto the HTML editor inserts an image tag with the relative path to the image (from this HTML file), the hight and width, and the alt text as the version of the filename: dragging gives me:. PHP Autocompletion for parent methods. When you overwrite a parent method you often need to call it from the new method, example: Aptana does not autocomplete the methods after Suggested fix: Attempt to replicate Check to see if the item is fixed in or in a newer version of the parsers If not in our code and can't be fixed, link to PDT issue referencing the problem.

For authorization based endpoint filtering we need to introduce the authorizer actions outlined via MESOS-4932.. Currently two formats of credentials are supported: JSON And a deprecated new line file: We deprecated the new line format in and should remove it after the deprecation cycle ends..

From MESOS-313: The Scheduler interface has a callback for utorLost, but currently it is never called.. Running `sudo make check` on CentOS for Mesos causes several several. If I set on the master, framework and slave authentication are allowed, but not required. On the other hand, http authentication is now required for authenticated endpoints (currently only ` shutdown`). That means that I cannot enable framework or slave authentication without also enabling http endpoint This is undesirable. Framework and slave authentication have separate flags and to require authentication for each. It would be great if there was also such a flag for http Or maybe we get rid of these flags altogether and rely on ACLs to determine which principals are even allowed to authenticate for each. Include ExecutorInfos for custom utors in. ",14,341,2137

162,mesos,avinash@mesosphere.io,"I am not sure a single end point serve any purpose here. The endpoints need to be canonical since the operator would want to rebootstrap each of these entities (isolators) individually (there is no dependency between them. This implies that if we have a single end point something will have route the requests to right isolator (probably the which will automatically happen if at the `libprocess` level if we separate end points for each isolator.. Currently there are no default `network` isolators for With the development of the `network cni` isolator we have an interface to run Mesos on multitude of IP networks. Given that its based on an open standard (the CNI spec) which is gathering a lot of traction from vendors (calico, weave, coreOS) and already works on some default networks (bridge, ipvlan, macvlan) it makes sense to make it as the default network isolator.. Setup proper etc hostname, etc hosts and for containers in network cni isolator.. Most docker and appc images wish to expose ports that micro-services are listening on, to the outside world. When containers are running on bridged (or ptp) networking this can be achieved by installing port forwarding rules on the agent (using iptables). This can be done in the `network cni` isolator. The reason we would like this functionality to be implemented in the `network cni` isolator, and not a CNI plugin, is that the specifications currently do not support specifying port forwarding rules. Further, to install these rules the isolator needs two pieces of information, the exposed ports and the IP address associated with the container. Bother are available to the isolator.. But how would the CNI isolator know if the underlying plugin has the capability or not? Or for that matter the parameters that it needs to pass to the plugin?. Introduce a port field in in order to set exposed ports for a container.. Networking isolators such as `network cni` need to learn about ports that a container wishes to be exposed to the outside world. This can be achieved by adding a field to the protobuf and allowing the to set these fields to inform the isolator of the ports that the container wishes to be exposed.. Get container status information in slave.. As part of MESOS-4487 an interface will be introduce into the to allow agents to retrieve container state information. The agent needs to use this interface to retrieve container state information during status updates from the utor. The container state information can be then use by the agent to expose various isolator specific configuration (for IP address allocated by network isolators, net cls handles allocated by isolator), that has been applied to the container, in the endpoint.. The isolator is responsible for allocating network handles to containers launched within a net cls cgroup. The isolator needs to expose these handles to the containerizer as part of the when the containerizer queries the status() method of the isolator. The information itself will go as part of a `CgroupInfo` protobuf that will be defined as part of MESOS-4488 .. The isolator needs to expose handles in the ContainerStatus. Introduce status() interface in `Containerizer`. As part of implementing the net cls cgroup isolator we need a mechanism to manage the minor handles that will be allocated to containers when they are associated with a net cls cgroup. The network-handle manager needs to provide the following functionality: a) During normal operation keep track of the free and allocated network handles. There can be a total of 64K such network handles. b) On startup, learn the allocated network handle by walking the net cls cgroup tree for mesos and build a map of free network handles available to the agent.. The net cls cgroup associates a 16-bit major and 16-bit minor network handle to packets originating from tasks associated with a specific net cls cgroup. In mesos we need to give the operator the ability to fix the 16-bit major handle used in an agent (the minor handle will be allocated by the agent. See MESOS-4345). Fixing the parent handle on the agent allows operators to install default firewall rules using the parent handle to enforce a default policy (say DENY ALL) for all container traffic till the container is allocated a minor handle. A simple way to achieve this requirement is to pass the major handle as a flag to the agent at startup.. ",14,735,4368
163,mesos,jieyu,"Currently, if a container uses container image, we'll do a bind mount of its sandbox ( - in the host mount namespace. However, doing the mounts in the host mount table is not ideal. That complicates both the cleanup path and the recovery path. Instead, we can do the sandbox bind mount in the container's mount namespace so that cleanup and recovery will be greatly simplified. We can setup mount propagation properly so that persistent volumes mounted at xxx can be propagated into the container. Here is a simple proof of concept: Console 1: Console 2: Console 1: Console 2:. does not handle empty string correctly.. Executor env variables should not be leaked to the command task.. Currently, command task inherits the env variables of the command utor. This is less ideal because the command utor environment variables include some Mesos internal env variables like MESOS XXX and Also, this behavior does not match what Docker containerizer does. We should construct the env variables from scratch for the command task, rather than relying on inheriting the env variables from the command utor.. So that when a user task is forked, it does not hold extra references to the sandbox mount and provisioner bind backend mounts. If we don't do that, we could get the following error message when cleaning up bind backend mount points and sandbox mount points.. When running the tests as root, we found fails consistently on some platforms. Turns out that the 'rmdir' after the 'umount' fails with EBUSY because there's still some references to the mount. FYI. Removing mount point fails with EBUSY in. This is related to MESOS-3095 and MESOS-3227. The idea is that we should allow command utor to run under host filesystem and provision the filesystem for the user. The command line utor will then chroot into user's root filesystem. This solves the issue that the command utor is not launchable in the user specified root filesystem. The design doc is here:. Appc spec specifies two image discovery mechanisms: simple and meta discovery. We need to have an abstraction for image discovery in AppcStore. For MVP, we can implement the simple discovery first. Update: simple discovery is removed from the spec. Meta discovery is the only discovery mechanism right now in the spec. Simple discovery is already shipped (we support an arbitrary operator specified ). So this ticket should focus on implementing Meta discovery.. Implement a utility for computing hash. Marco, can you re-run the failing tests using and paste the results here? Thanks. Implement OverlayFS based provisioner backend. Support pre-fetching images. Default container images can be specified with the flag to the slave. This may be a large image that will take a long time to initially when the first container is provisioned. Add optional support to start fetching the image when the slave starts and consider not registering until the fetch is complete. To extend that, we should support an operator endpoint so that operators can specify images to pre-fetch.. Implement AppC image provisioner.. Introduce filesystem provisioner abstraction. Right now, the resource monitor returns a Usage which contains ContainerId, ExecutorInfo and In order for resource estimator qos controller to calculate usage slack, or tell if a container is using revokable resources or not, we need to expose the Resources that are currently assigned to the container. This requires us the change the containerizer interface to get the Resources as well while calling 'usage()'.. commit Author: Jie Yu Date: Wed May 6 2015 -0700 Added resources estimator abstraction for Review:. Right now, we use a sleep command to control the duration of perf sampling: This causes an additional process the sleep process) to be forked and causes troubles for us to terminate the perf sampler once the slave exits (See MESOS-2462). Seems that the additional sleep process is not necessary. The slave can just monitor the duration and send a SIGINT to the perf process when duration elapsed.

Enable actors to pass an authentication realm to libprocess. To prepare for MESOS-4902, the Mesos master and agent need a way to pass the desired authentication realm to libprocess.

Some more links for posterity:. Perf event isolator stops performing sampling if a single timeout occurs.. Currently the perf event isolator times out a sample after a fixed extra time of 2 seconds on top of the sample time elapses: This should be based on the reap interval maximum. Also, the code stops sampling altogether when a single timeout occurs. We've observed time outs during normal operation, so it would be better for the isolator to continue performing perf sampling in the case of timeouts. It may also make sense to continue sampling in the case of errors, since these may be transient.. Add support for to aid isolators controlling access to devices.

This would allow us to vet the v1 API and the scheduler library in test clusters.. Executor driver does not respect utor shutdown grace period.. Executor shutdown grace period, configured on the agent, is propagated to utors via the environment variable. The utor driver must use this timeout to delay the hard shutdown of the related utor.. There are two ways in which a shutdown of utor can be triggered: 1. If it receives an explicit `Shutdown` message from the agent. 2. If the recovery timeout period has elapsed, and the utor still hasnt been able to (re-)connect with the agent. Currently, the utor library relies on the field having a default value of 5 seconds to handle the second scenario. utor The driver used to trigger the grace period via a constant defined in .cpp L92 The agent may want to force a shorter shutdown grace period eviction may have shorter deadline) in the future. For now, we can just read the value via an environment variable.. Remove field from Shutdown event v1 protobuf.. We need to migrate the existing tests in to use the new callback interface introduced in . The changes to would be done when MESOS-4831 is resolved. For an example see which already uses this new interface.. My understanding is that the recommended path for the v1 scheduler API is , but the HTTP endpoint for this endpoint list the path as ; the filename of the doc page is also in the subdirectory. Similarly, we document the master state endpoint as , whereas the preferred name is now just , and so on for most of the other endpoints. Unlike we the V1 API, we might want to consider backward compatibility and document both forms sure. But certainly it seems like we should encourage people to use the shorter paths, not the longer ones.. Previously, all status update messages from the utor were forwarded by the agent to the master in the order that they had been received. However, that seems to be no longer valid due to a recently introduced change in the agent: This can sometimes lead to status updates being sent out of order depending on the order the is fulfilled from the call to ..

Showed up on ASF CI: The test crashed with the following logs: There was another test which failed right after completion with a similar stack trace:. We need to add tests for the utor library . One possible approach would be to use the existing tests in and make them use the new utor library.. Currently, the slave process generates a process ID every time it is initialized via function call. This is a problem for testing HTTP utors as it can't retry if there is a disconnection after an agent restart since the prefix is incremented. There are a couple of ways to fix this: - Add a constructor to exclusively for testing that passes on a fixed instead of relying on . - Currently we delegate to (1) when nothing is specified as the URL in libprocess would delegate to . Instead of defaulting to (1), we can default to the last known active ID.. This endpoint is for removing quotas via the DELETE method.. Current rules around this are pretty confusing and undocumented, as evidenced by some recent bugs in this area. Some example snippets in the mesos source code that were a result of this confusion and are indeed bugs: 1.. C++ HTTP Scheduler Library does not work with SSL enabled. The C++ HTTP scheduler library does not work against Mesos when SSL is enabled (without downgrade). The fix should be simple: If SSL is enabled, connections should be made with HTTPS instead of HTTP.. If is enabled on a master, frameworks attempting to use the HTTP Scheduler API can't register. is already supported for HTTP based frameworks.. Implement AuthN handling in Master for the Scheduler endpoint. If you pass a nonsense string for ""master"" into a framework using the C++ HTTP scheduler library, the framework segfaults. For example, using the example frameworks: Results in: Results in. AFAICT, HTTP Pipelining is defined only for requests to the same . It does not guarantee that requests to two different URL's on the same server would return responses in order. In fact, this would be quite obvious by this example: Let's say your server hosts two and , and the request is first sent to , then to . It would always be possible that the computation done by the URL, would be more then and might in turn make return first then . Can you point me out to any bits in the RFC that discuss the behavior you outlined in the example ?. The Mesos UI is broken, it seems to fail to represent JSON from state. This may have been introduced with. Currently, our testing infrastructure does not have a mechanism of HTTP events of a particular type from the Scheduler API response stream. We need a abstraction that can help us to filter a particular event type. This helper code is duplicated in at least two places currently, Scheduler Primitives tests. - The solution can be as trivial as moving this helper function to a common test-header. - Implement a similar to what we do for other protobufs via .. Currently , in libprocess, does not support HTTP pipelining. Each call as of know sends in the header, thereby, signaling to the server to close the TCP socket after the response. We either need to create a new interface for supporting HTTP pipelining , or modify the existing to do so. This is needed for the library to make sure ""Calls"" are sent in order to the master. Currently, in order to do so, we send in the next request only after we have received a response for an earlier call that results in degraded performance.. Agent : Create Basic Functionality to handle call endpoint. This is the first basic step in ensuring the basic call functionality: - Set up the route on the agent for utor"" endpoint. - The endpoint should perform basic validation and return for now. - Introduce initial tests in that just verify the status code.. call endpoint on the slave will return a 202 accepted code but has to do some basic validations before. In case of invalidation it will return a back to the client. - We need to create the required infrastructure to validate the request and then process it similar to in the check if the protobuf is properly initialized, has the required attributes set pertaining to the call message etc..

The status updates for each task are not necessarily received in the same order as launching the tasks. See for the explanation. The related logs are above the comment.. It might also be worthwhile to check if the tests fail without .. The documentation currently assumes that oversubscribed resources () are the only type of revocable resources. Optimistic offers will add a second type of revocable resource () that should not be acted upon by components. For example, the says the following: NOTE: If any resource used by a task or utor is revocable, the whole container is treated as a revocable container and can therefore be killed or throttled by the QoS Controller. which we may amend to something like: NOTE: If any resource used by a task or utor is revocable usage slack, the whole container is treated as an oversubscribed container and can therefore be killed or throttled by the QoS Controller.. Two patches from some of my initial investigation into the approach: Update to code:. Test-only libprocess. Libprocess initialization includes the spawning of a variety of global processes and the creation of the server socket which listens for incoming requests. Some properties of the server socket are configured via environment variables, such as the IP and port or the SSL configuration. In the case of tests, libprocess is initialized once per test binary. This means that testing different configurations (SSL in particular) is cumbersome as a separate process would be needed for every test case. Add some optional code between some tests like: See for more on .. The messages we pass between Mesos components are largely undocumented. See this .. Currently, the HTTP Scheduler library does not support SSL-enabled Mesos. (You can manually test this by spinning up an SSL-enabled master and attempt to run the event-call framework example against We need to add tests that check the HTTP Scheduler library against SSL-enabled Mesos: with required certifications, with without verification of certificates * with a custom certificate authority (CA) These options should be controlled by the same environment variables found on the .

It is important to change this before maintenance primitives are released: Also, a minor change to the error message from these endpoints:. The previous changes (MESOS-3345) to support integer precision when converting JSON Protobuf did not support precision for unsigned integers between and . (There's some loss, but the conversion is still as good bad as it was with This problem is due to a limitation in the JSON parsing library we use (PicoJSON), which parses integers as . Some possible solutions or things to investigate: We can investigate using another parsing library. * If we want extra precision beyond 64 or 80 bits per double, one possibility is the . We'd still need to change the parsing library though.. We currently have some helper functionality for V1 API tests. This is copied in a few test files. Factor this out into a common place once the API is stabilized. We can also update the helpers in to support the V1 API. This would let us get ride of lines like: In favor of:. For the background, see the parent story . For the see the linked design document (below).. Add either log rotation or capped-size logging (for tasks). Tasks currently log their output stdout stderr) to files (the ""sandbox"") on an agent's disk. In some cases, the accumulation of these logs can completely fill up the agent's disk and thereby kill the task or machine. To prevent this, we should either implement a log rotation mechanism or capped-size logging. This would be used by utors to control the amount of logs they keep. Master agent logs will not be affected. We will first scope out several possible approaches for log in a design document (see ). Once an approach is chosen, this story will be broken down into some corresponding issues.. For , we added some protobufs to represent time with integer precision. However, this precision is not maintained through protobuf JSON conversion, because of how our JSON convert numbers to floating point. To maintain precision, we can try one of the following: Add logic to numbers without loss when possible. Update PicoJson and add a compiler flag, In all cases, we'll need to make sure that: The JSON decoder parses the integer without loss. * We have some unit tests for big (close to ) and small integers.. Documentation images do not load. Any images which are referenced from the generated docs () do not show up on the website. For example: *. In the process of adding the Cmake build system, noted and stubbed out all OS-specific code. That sweep (mostly of libprocess and stout) is here: Instead of having inline , the OS-specific code will be separated into directories. The Windows code will be stubbed out.. Persisted info is fetched from the registry when a master is elected or after failover. Currently, this process involves 3 steps: Start an operation to add the new master to the fetched registry. ** Change the ""Recovery"" test to include checks for the new object.. In order to modify the maintenance schedule in the replicated registry, we will need Operations The operations will likely correspond to the HTTP API: Given a set of machines, verify then transition machines from Draining to Deactivated. * Given a set of machines, verify then transition machines from Deactivated to Normal. Remove affected machines from the schedule(s).. This is primarily a refactoring. The prototype for modifying the registry is currently: In order to support Maintenance schedules (possibly Quotas as well), there should be an alternate prototype for Maintenance. Something like: The existing should be refactored to allow for more than one key. If necessary, refactor existing operations defined in (AdminSlave, ReadminSlave, RemoveSlave).. In order to persist maintenance schedules across failovers of the master, the schedule information must be kept in the replicated registry. This means adding an additional message in the Registry protobuf in The status of each individual slave's maintenance will also be persisted in this way. Note: There can be multiple SlaveID's attached to a single hostname.. Replicated registry needs a representation of maintenance schedules. Maintenance information is not populated in case of failover. When a master starts up, or after a master has failed, it must re-populate maintenance information from the registry to the local state). Particularly, in should be changed to process maintenance information.. Slaves are not deactivated upon reaching a maintenance window. Master does not handle InverseOffers in the Accept call (Event Call API). Offers are currently sent from to framework via InverseOffers, which are roughly equivalent to negative Offers, can be sent in the same package. In Sent InverseOffers can be tracked in the master's local state: In One actor (master or allocator) should populate the new InverseOffers field. is where the and Offer object is constructed. In the allocator InverseOffers negative resources) allocation could be calculated in this method. Accept resource offer, start task. Check that are sent to the framework. Check that more are sent. Check that more are sent.. does not send InverseOffers to resources to be maintained. In the Event Call API, the Decline call is currently used by frameworks to reject resource offers. In the case of InverseOffers, the framework could give additional information to the operators and or allocator, as to why the InverseOffer is declined. Suppose a cluster running some consensus algorithm is given an InverseOffer on one of its nodes. It may decline saying ""Too few nodes"" (or, more verbosely, ""Specified InverseOffer would lower the number of active nodes below quorum""). This change requires the following changes: Change to either store the reason, or log it. Extend the interface in ** Add change the declineOffer method in. Decline call does not include an optional ""reason"", in the Event Call API. Resource offers do not contain given a maintenance schedule. The master will need to do a number of things to implement the maintenance primitives: For machines that have a maintenance window: For unused resources, offers must be augmented with an Filter them before sending them again. * For declined inverse offers, do something with the reason (store or log). Recover the maintenance information upon failover. Note: Some amount of this logic will need to be placed in the allocator.. Based on MESOS-1474, we'd like to provide an HTTP API on the master for the maintenance primitives in mesos. For the MVP, we'll want something like this for manipulating the schedule: (Note: The slashes in URLs might not be supported A schedule might look like: There should be firewall settings such that only those with access to master can use these endpoints..

242,mule,alejandro.garcia,"The discussion for this feature appeared with the inheritance of metadata resolvers (from the Extension or the Operation class). What happens is that if you have an operation which doesn't need a dynamic resolver but the parent has one defined, it should be applied if the operation return type is a Map or Object. With that solution we avoid the need of an annotation. The other thing is that in SDK we want to be as restrictive as possible with the developer, and it may be a good idea to forbid operations which return type is Map and doesn't have a resolver assigned.. Enforce metadata dynamic output resolver for Map and Object. We need to define how metaData will be resolved as a service from Mule and how it will be related to the Extension and its model.

HTTP listener should ignore property as it is a header. is a header and therefore shouldn't really be used by HTTP listener if there is a property present in the outbound property scope to determine response streaming behaviour. Generally current behaviour is fine, but there is one case that is currently incorrect IMO. We shouldn't stream a String payload when the and outbound message properties are both present. AUTO Behaviour appears to be inconsistent with HTTP requestor because the presence of both headers results in no streaming with requestor, but streaming with listener*. dispose() should not be invoked if initialise() fails. At least thats how I believe it always worked. This change causes NPE's in dispose() in a lot of cases. Which results in much more verbose and confusing errores being logged..

Inconsistent implementation of between listener and requestor.. There are a number of cases tested in where even when chunking is still used. In my mind it should be the ""AUTO"" mode that decided if it should use chunking based on i) payload type ii) presence of headers.

The problem should be logged and the task should continue processing as many records member repositories as possible. For an example problem, see NEXUS-8568.. not found cache should be expired for packages with implied references from updated package metadata. deprecate and disable the ""download nuget feed"" scheduled task. Start nx3 for the first time. empty storage. Add an HTTP proxy to Nexus. Trust the SSL certificate my proxy serves using the SSL Certificates UI ( this works fine and goes through proxy) GET Request is 200 and works, but request does not go through proxy server tested. nexus pro log may report nexus as unlicensed on startup even when it is. make it easier to find the nexus software license. Connection leak in Browse Remote when content encoding is gzip. Create a Maven 2 proxy repository to called `Yum-Newrelic` a request at this path is uting ( and ultimately returns with 302 or 404 ): before this request ends, a request at these paths at the same time fail or throw errors:. concurrent request paths cause during population of not found cache. support zip generation fails if system has mounted clearcase volumes. The forgot feature rest resource ( ) of Nexus can cause performance issues against an external realm. We should consider options such as: - optimizing the generic queries that the resource performs for external users - provide a configurable way to disable the feature - consider removing the feature entirely if that is easier - removing the Forgot Username and Forgot Password resource privs from the built in anonymous role. Acceptance Criteria: - Remove Forgot feature from UI (just remove the js code). forgot password feature performs badly with external realms. Create a npm hosted repo with id 'npm-hosted'. Publish one package into it. Hit the - all resource for this repo. Verify the published package metadata. Delete the entire npm hosted repo using the repository Delete button. Create another npm hosted repo with the same id. Hit the - all resource for this repo again - you still get metadata about the first repo even though the new repo contains nothing. Similar: delete all the content from a hosted npm repo but leave the repo itself. Nexus still serves metadata about packages which do not exist. Expire cache on the hosted repo does not help.. Tried to run rebuild hosted npm metadata task ( new in ) against about 500MB of tgz packages from the strongloop registry. Had several messages of concern - unsure as to the overall seriousness of each of these:. maven site deployments with .. in paths fail. resuming downloads for unsatisfiable Range should respond with 416 or 200 instead of 206. Currently a request to logout with a valid session cookie, will delete the server side session in Nexus, so that the originally sent session cookie value is no longer valid in the browser. However the response that comes back should ( but does not ) ask the user-agent to delete expire the existing session cookie, so that it does not bother trying to send it again. We should make logout return a Set-Cookie header as expected that forces delete expiry of the session cookie.. should ask the user-agent to delete the session cookie. allow nexus to load outreach content by and user. Secure flag should be set on Set-Cookie values dynamically based on if the inbound request is reported as secure by the container hosting Nexus, instead of using the configurable option provided by NEXUS-7800. provide a scheduled task to rebuild the npm metadata from storage data for hosted repositories. non-snapshot versions containing SNAPSHOT can bypass a release repository Deployment Policy. npm groups should merge versions of the same package in different members. in pom validator staging rule. capture generation time in analytics event-zip as reference. limit size of analytics event zip files at creation and submission. downloading specific versions of NuGet packages via Visual Studio package manager console fails. Upgrade to Apache Tika for better mime detection. The clm server password is not removed from the file in a generated support zip:. npm install cmd can trigger nexus NPE and 500 status when remote returns non-standard fields and stub attachments. programatically enforce minimum requirements for yum configuration including debug messages. allow configuring and on Nexus outbound HTTP client connections. Show ""Browse Storage"", ""Browse Remote"", ""Mirrors"", in ""Summary"" tab based on repository type. npm hosted repository should maintain ""time"" field on deploys. If I am a savvy user and am using over HTTPS, and issue a metadata request like this one: It will tell me to get the tarball over HTTP. What is the point of HTTPS then? As I checked, both HTTP and HTTPS URLs works for tarball. NPM registry issue was told to close it, then we filed was told to close it, then we to get some traction.. comma in group membership attribute value breaks static LDAP group mapping. maven staging plugin -1 on release using Java 8. and master branches have been updated A note that we are justifying this change because the NuGet features have moved into OSS recently We expect the host resources available to OSS users to be similar to pro users now as well. Specifically the heap sizes are changed as follows in. Configure ldap config to a valid server with 5000 users. Open users management. Change the source to LDAP. Nexus now makes 5000+ group member queries and tries to load 5000 records into the Nexus UI. More than likely Nexus UI will timeout and not render anything - meanwhile the queries are happily proceeding as requested in the backend. This will either crash LDAP, crash Nexus or crash the browser.. prevent from creating sqlite rpm metadata. NEXUS-6189 introduced not returning headers for 401 web browser content responses. This is non-standard behaviour. A customer wants to upgrade to latest Nexus, and when they did, this broke some internal tooling that relied on Disabling the browser detector is not a good long term solution for them because their internal tool is already deployed to production. The request is to add some way to specify a user agent string that can always be treated as a non-browser, and therefore return the default authenticate headers.. running . start n times, starts the container n times. Yum metadata for proxy repositories should refer to the URL of the source Nexus instance. add more robust proxy repository URL validation. upgrade from previously upgraded OSS to Pro ldap configuration can fail subsequent upgrades. LDAP OSS to Pro upgrade bug, multiple configuration fields are not migrated. allow direct request for NuGet artifact through proxy repository if artifact is not already cached in the local feed. Nuget: return 403 with reason instead of 404 when redirection fails through a proxy server. Crowd plugin that is not configured logs when viewing security roles. CLM application drop down when editing a staging profile has some confusing items. - it asks to choose ""(none)"" when it is not even an option if CLM is not configured. - it asks to ""select an application"" when one can't be selected since CLM is not configured, OR the license prevents display of an app OR CLM user does not have permissions to the app.. upgrade to HTTP client. Smart Proxy download immediately option for checksum updates sends duplicate download requests for main artifact. OBR virtual repository metadata update fails when triggered by smart proxy download immediately. uncompressed archives with HTML file as an entry can be rejected by file content validation. Archive browser doesn't work for NuGet .nupkg packages. ERROR log message from M2Repository - does not include root cause throwable. Nexus logs may contain an ERROR log message similar to the following ( not specific to this particular artifact ): ERROR anonymous - Got in proxy repository ""Atlassian"" while caching retrieved artifact got from URL will attempt next mirror, cause: Cause: Expected: This log message should include a stack trace to better understand what led to this problem.. A comment with security level 'Developers' was removed.. inbound request URL syntax validity should be checked and fail fast. Inbound request URLs that contain certain invalid characters may bypass basic syntax checking and cause Nexus to perform more internal work then necessary. This can also cause Nexus to report noisy WARN messages in the logs. Expected: Nexus should perform URL syntax validation as early as possible and fail with simple log messages instead of verbose WARN when a URL is syntactically invalid. The HTTP response should return a 400 status in this case.. Enter as the search term for the key and value fields in metadata search. You get an ugly error dialog in In the error dialog is less ugly although the error message could be improved to be less technical. The 'home page' link in the error dialog is broken. ( 404). Enhancement: Tie OData to Lucene index (for performance). Create a Nuget Repo Group containing one each of Nuget Proxy, hosted, virtual repos. Create an Expire Repository Caches task. Notice that the NuGet proxy and Nuget Hosted Repos are available to select in the task configuration, however NuGet Group is not. Compare this with the fact a Maven 2 Group Repo can be selected for this task.. Enhancement: Browse Index tab for NuGet repos. Given that a user can browse an Index of Maven artifacts via the Browse Index tab, and given oData information may be made indexable with lucene in Nexus UI, it may be suitable to support a Browse Index view of nupkg artifacts from within the Nexus UI. The usefulness of this may be in question for NuGet repos however since developers will typically use NuGet Package Explorer to 'explore' nupkg artifacts.. Not having JCE cause problems with some installation We should detect if it is installed, and if it is installed, log the fact at INFO. Apparently calling this will work for this purpose: It will return 128 if no JCE is installed, 2147483647 if it is.. Print message in log if high-strength JCE is installed. If yum metadata generation fails the output of the command should always be logged. The support tools tab does not show how to contact support. The edition should have a link to the ""create ticket"" link in the support site (. Add end-user instructions for support ticket creation in Support Tools UI. nuget local repos feeds should support nuspec dependency optional attribute. Starting in Nexus automatic upgrade of versions of Nexus older than are no longer supported. Upgrades to Nexus or newer must first upgrade to the latest version first, then upgrade to the latest version.. ui dialogs display literal html tags. make a UI request to Nexus that will timeout. the simplest is start nexus, login, shutdown nexus and make another ui request. You see a dialog that states the request timed out ( as expected ) but the message starts with '' This is just one example. Other dialogs have the same escaping problem.. improve Remove Releases from Repository task performance. As said in summary. When first scheduled, we had an oom exception. So we increased the max memory to 1 GiB. After that we had no more oom issues. The task ran for 147h 43m 57s and finished successfully. During this time he cleaned up 8270 releases (as derived from the log entries ""Recreating Maven2 metadata in repository ID 'releases' from Disk space went from 134GiB down to 75GiB. While it was successfull I think this is incredibly slow. The fix might be similar to the one from issue NEXUS-4640. Fix: A new task option is added to make the task perform better.. Seeing this a lot in customer logs. Can we prevent this huge stack? Looks like request was ending in 4xx error and failed to write the template. Hopefully it cleans up after. Browse remote tab is visible for Nuget repos but should not be. To minimize any potential problems fronting nexus with Apache mod proxy or other reverse proxies using the headers, we should configure Jetty to acknowledge and respect any X-Forwarded headers by default. See Jetty Logic here: See Jetty Docs describing how to front Jetty with reverse proxy SSL: Related forum post: We should also update the book to mention how to set the header in httpd as well.. Role ID field should not appear editable after save of External Role Mapping. DN values containing "","" (comma) can result in improperly escaped LDAP filters. improve SNAPSHOT version detection when deploying release artifact to SNAPSHOT repository. Nexus upgrade does not properly back up changed configuration files.. Revert: Link to nexus book logging section in the logger UI. When setting ""Publish URL"" to false, prevent repo Summary tab from displaying 'undefined' distribution management section. Nexus is generating invalid at GA level. in your local hosted releases repo create the following paths: start Nexus if you haven't already. Login as admin. Browse releases repo local storage. You should see the file paths above. right click on each one and upon request. Also notice the '(Not Found)' text appended to tree paths when selected in the tree. See attached video for overview. behaved slightly different, finding more paths, but also returning server error for the one with percent sign, where simply says Not Found.. hanging test using Jetty 6x windows. Noticed was hanging for 11 hours and took a thread dump of the stuck surefire process.. Only proxy repositories should participate in not found cache (NFC) to improve performance. We should log this at DEBUG:. If a capability is created and then encounters a configuration error, the description will contain the word FAILED: followed by the class name of the see NXCM-3681 ) When trying to delete the capability you will be asked for confirmation with a message such as ""Delete the ""FAILED: capability?"" It would be more logical to use the capability type instead of description here, or neither of these. See attached screenshot for an example of how this looks.. Attributes Upgrader logs duplicate stack trace when a file is not found and stops. Index: 2, Size: 0 editing group membership. This was seen running the load test described in NEXUS-4744 h3. Variations of the same theme. Create a Synchronize Shadow Repository. In the repository selection list, all repositories are shown - however this task only applies to Virtual Shadow repositories. Expected only the repository type that applies to this task to be listed. setting up the task against a repo that does not apply does no harm - those repos are just ignored.. Local Timezone description should be displayed in screens editing times of a scheduled task. docs indicate wrong result type. Hosted maven-site repository summary Distribution Management section wrong - refers to. make default value of Publish URL ""True"" when creating a group repository. Information unnecessarily logged as ERROR when repository put out of service. repository CYCLE detected log message is misleading. Authentication error shows up as ""400 bad request"" during smtp validation.. ",152,3756,22322
284,nexus,jtom,"I noticed a bunch of warns like this when testing docker It appeared there was one for every layer I pulled that wasn't in the repository when I pulled from a docker group. For reference, some images can have 5-7+ layers. Pulling from proxy generated no such warn. There was no warn for layers that already existed so hypothetically this would be a diminishing concern over time (tho you could be utilizing new layers everyday, not sure how it works in practice). This seems excessive to do on the WARN level when there is no (as far as I can tell) adverse behavior. Filing for triage discussion. I did not check older NX3 or older docker at this time.. noted that he was seeing messages like: WARN *SYSTEM - Could not locate scanner descriptor"" This message was listed in NEXUS-8239 ( 5) but I believe at the time got mixed in with the actual 5 report (the double message) and I overlooked making a cleanup ticket against it. This occurs when you run the RHC tasks against a repository. Possible quick fix might be to add an empty properties file but code check would need to be done.. I noticed after uploading a license, that the license area shows ""This field is required"". This statement is not there before uploading. See attached. I am not totally convinced we need validation at all with the way our licensing is currently setup, but if we do have it I think the order of value is: 1) Show it when 2) Show it always 3) Show it after success License uploading has been broken for a while so not bothering to back check older NX3 as I'd need to check back before it was even broken (pre-official releases). I did not check NX2 at this time.. Noticed that when using a context path in Nexus when you put that path into your .bowerrc the resultant interactions error with errors like below. Only workaround seems to be not to use a context path. I am not sure how critical context path is for people so leaving major for now. On sudo bower install jquery bower not-cached nexus+ bower resolve nexus+ bower error (HTTP 404) Stack trace: Error: (HTTP 404) Request. at Console trace: Error Logger. rejected System info: Bower version: Node version: OS: Darwin x64 Setup was with a single bower group containing a bower proxy and context path nexus . Bower is new to so no backcheck (or NX2 check) can be done.. First time starting nexus via docker has karaf log warn. Starting nexus for the first time via docker generates the below warn.

I found I cannot generate a file from the UI including everything checked in Windows. This does not occur in MacOSX. I checked with who was also able to see this, so not just my env. See below for long stack trace with several errors. On screen appears ""Cannot get property 'file' on null object"". This does not affect m7. I did not check NX2 at this time. Debug was off during this test.. I noticed that if you attempt to enter a value into ""Connection field within the ""HTTP request settings"" section of a proxy repository configuration you get an error ""Failed to Validate Facets, 1 Failure"" and the below in the This occurs with debug on or off. I did not check older NX3 at this time. This does not occur in ERROR admin - Failed to validate facet: Can not instantiate value of type from Floating-point number no method at (through reference chain: Source) Method) at 102 common frames omitted. Error on LDAP Realm activeness; can stop LDAP logins. I created a new raw hosted repository and then created a new role with read and edit repository view privileges to that new repository. Then I created a new user and gave it that new role. I noticed that I was able to add a file to that raw repository despite not having add privilege. As far as I know, add is not contained in edit and this seems a bug. I did not back check older NX3 or NX2 at this time. NX2 did use CRUD rather than BREAD which is testable however not sure the comparison is worth it unless to regression check.. running rebuild npm hosted metadata scheduled task can change repository value. Some fields allow adding but not removal via keyboard. A comment with security level 'Developers' was removed.. A comment with security level 'Developers' was removed.. noticed in NX3 when you search for an unknown component it returns our 404 html rather than the handled error. Example of current: Example of expected: After checks with and , he asked me to file if I saw the same (which I do). I did not back check older versions of NX3, but I recall seeing this for a while and just assumed it was as it was supposed to be. Might be we deployed this way. I did not check NX2 at this time.. A comment with security level 'Developers' was removed.. resource does not check drop privilege. A comment with security level 'Developers' was removed.. Looking at a support issue I attempted UNKNOWN - Service failure Detected content type , but expected : Source) Source) at Source) Source) Source) Source) Source) Source) Source) Source) Source) Source) Source) Source) Source) Source) Source) All works with strict content type validation off. This is NOT the issue the user was seeing, however, does show a possible issue with content type validation and docker.. Content type validation blocks some docker fetching. Base URL capability has a validation message for the URL field ""must be a valid URL"" - rest of the site has 'This field should be a URL in the format "" I looked to make it consistent but couldn't find it in github so I am ticketing instead. I made this a bug rather than an improvement because I think the level of confusion is potentially high if you enter and it asks for a ""valid URL"". I did not check older NX3 or NX2 at this time.. A comment with security level 'Developers' was removed.. Restore Task's notification email help text. Hourly scheduled tasks can not run when UI next reports. Adjusting a schedule task updates last run and last result fields. Blocking repository does nothing. Installer does not create desktop icon in CentOS KDE. While testing the installer I ran a basic setup and at the end ""Completing the Sonatype Nexus Setup Wizard"", I kept 'Create Desktop Icons' checked. On CentOS KDE the icon did not create. I tried several permutations of installs and no dice. This blocked testing of several issues I was trying to test in Linux. On CentOS GNOME it did create so nothing is currently blocked however, I am filing at least because I believe it's worth documenting something not working when it is checked. Marking minor however I guess it's arguable if you're using CentOS KDE ) Recommendation to send to install4j. Review with Joe to see if increasing the logging levels gives better information.. Logger related(?) error at top of console after reset. noticed that he set the logger to TRACE, restarted nexus, and the logger value of was reset to ERROR. I was able to repro this but it does not happen for all loggers. I checked and the values are defined there but for some reason it is not picked up. We discussed whether this was a ""feature"" or not and also discussed if it has to do with customized loggers (and potentially the change from NEXUS-9327). When testing NEXUS-9327 I did not include restarting in the test Despite that discussion I did not check older NX3 at this time, nor did I check NX2. Debug was off during this test.. Can't create external LDAP Role mapping. A comment with security level 'Developers' was removed.. A comment with security level 'Developers' was removed..

A comment with security level 'Developers' was removed.. A comment with security level 'Developers' was removed.. I noticed that if I went to Custom Search from any of the other child searches (Docker, Maven, NuGet, Raw) I got a continual loading mask that did not go away. If you go from Search parent or outside stuff (such as Welcome or Browse) it works. This occurs with Debug on and off and nothing in the log js console shows (though I mull if it's really continual that's why). This occurs with contents in the repos or with a fresh (content free) install. None of the other child searches seem affected in this way. I've attached a screen since it's about the same info as a vid, but if you want a vid let me know. I did not check older NX3 or NX2 at this time.. A comment with security level 'Developers' was removed.. A comment with security level 'Developers' was removed.. Support Zip page prompts for discard. I noticed when I created a Support Zip (via Admin Support) that when I removed some of the check boxes (I left ""System information report"" as well as the two Options) then closed the browser or navigated away I was prompted to discard changes or go back. This page is not able to be saved to my knowledge, so I think this prompt is out of place. Test done with debug off. NX2 is not affected by this. I did not check older NX3.. noticed that on the page the Realm list dropdown initially shows no items in it unless you go to the page first. This can be reproed both by logging in directly to or by logging in normally and navigating to before going to Then click on the realm dropdown. See vid. Both of us recall seeing this or something akin before but could not find a related ticket. I suspect this affects older versions of NX3 because of this but did not back check at this time. This does not affect NX2 because the setup is different. Testing done with debug off.. In case it helps, I am not seeing this on master on the quick. So either, that may lend a solution or it sometimes does not occur.. IE(11): Errors & non-functional pages after minimal site use. A comment with security level 'Developers' was removed.. Errors after logging in from anonymous to some pages. A comment with security level 'Developers' was removed.. Browse Repository scroll not infinite. A comment with security level 'Developers' was removed.. Finishing asset detail page testing (NEXUS-8255), I noticed that NuGet assets were being listed and downloaded in the form of If you rename the download to it's proper name (in this case original file was or even improper with a nupkg extension (tried they work. So the data is there, I think maybe just malformed slightly somehow. However, as far as download goes, I imagine it'd be pretty annoying to NuGet users trying to get their assets this way. Left major because of this. Asset details are new to Edgy so does not affect older NX3. I did not check NX2 at this time, tho I suspect unaffected. Test performed with Debug off.. A comment with security level 'Developers' was removed.. In order to use the Browse UI, you need read privileges (like below example). This is contradictory to search which you just need privileges (you need these for Browse UI as well). I am pretty confident this is a bug, because anonymous by default cannot use Browse UI (because of this). By default, anonymous shows it has no permission to see any repositories in Browse UI. Bringing up at least for triage; in case not a bug, don't think intuitive so I think worth documenting. Browse UI is new to Edgy so does not affect older NX3. I did not check NX2 at this time. Example:. Messages slow to fully appear sometimes. A comment with security level 'Developers' was removed.. While testing the Browse UI (NEXUS-8888 and various other tickets), I clicked into Unattached Assets and into details and got the attached errors (and it does not show more details). While NEXUS-8255 is not complete, I mentioned to and he asked me to file seperately. This is that ticket. There is nothing in the for this error (at default levels). This is a recent error, likely caused by initial NEXUS-8255 efforts, however, there were limited details shown before NEXUS-8255 efforts. Just stating this because I know this error does not occur in m4. This also does not occur in NX2.. Capabilities: Changing state does not change related aspects of UI. In Capabilities when you change the state the following items do not immediately update which could lead to confusion. * The enable disable buttons do not switch to reflect that one is no longer Create Capability - ""Base URL: Force"" (for example, any one should do; one already created probably ill advised) 3) Click to edit. Note State on the Summary tab is ""Active"". 4) Click Settings tab. Note active button is ""Disable"" and checkbox is checked (signifying Enabled). 5) Click ""Disable"" button. BUG: Checkbox remains checked (signifying Enabled) and active button remains ""Disable"". If you click back to the Summary tab, you'll note the state is still active.. After running the Rebuild Maven Repository Metadata task, I refreshed to see the status and noticed it said ""Unknown running"". This appears to be the default return. Analysis from states the task may be STARTING and suggestion is to add a state for that. I feel like this may be a recent change but maybe just unlucky timing on my side. I did not check older NX3 (task (re)added in m4) or NX2 at this time. I waffled between Bug and Improvement; bug for now but made it trivial. Debug was off when I noticed this.. when searching while searching. A comment with security level 'Developers' was removed.. A comment with security level 'Developers' was removed.. With tasks-read and tasks-create permissions, I can click the button to create a new task however, I cannot access some of the fields (including the required ones in both of the current tasks). Oddly, I can access some of the fields. Once I add ""tasks-update"" permission, the tasks become creatable. Not only does this seem odd but it's not how any of the other permissions I've tested function, so I'm filing for eval. I did not test older NX3 or NX2 at this time. Debug off during these tests.. A comment with security level 'Developers' was removed.. Noticed that in NX3, when configuring LDAP, the Verify User Mapping button gives the attached error and does nothing. This also appears as a JS error in the console: ""Uncaught me is not defined ADDENDUM: This shows as ""Uncaught me is not defined - with ?debug on. This works in NX2. I did not check older milestones of NX3 but this is not regression of the ticket discovered by. I am leaving this major because this is a super easy way to make sure this configuration is working before actually working with LDAP stuff. I am not sure if there's anywhere else that does that in one button click which makes for a poor workaround.. A comment with security level 'Developers' was removed.. A comment with security level 'Developers' was removed.. noticed that repositories with version policies cannot be saved. I checked master and see when I save I get a ""may not be null"" message under these. I checked through the default ones and think it just proxy and hosted maven that are affected. Alin says this is related to NEXUS-8503 and ""that is becuase disabling a field will result into those fields to not be submitted and that will not pass repository validation"". I guess when I checked that I only checked by sight, my bad Below also appears in the log: WARN admin - Validation failed; 1 constraints violated: 1) may not be null, type: class property: value: null This does not impact NX2 or older NX3 builds.. I noticed that the Online helper text (seen when creating or editing a repository) spans 3 lines and it seems it could be 1 line saving space and consolodating the page a bit. in seems to be defined as 1 string without breaks, so I assume this is a page ""issue"". We've specifically spoken about real estate on this page so filing improvement. This is recent regression to Dizzam and I suspect unintentional fallout (perhaps from ?). Spoke to about this before filing.. Chrome: Cannot use scroll wheel to view some bundles details. A comment with security level 'Developers' was removed.. FYI, today testing unrelated, I saw this behavior just switching from repo to repo (default ones) in OSS. I am not going to assume it's the same from the back and forth but wanted to relay. Am trying to come up with a reproducable case and if I can, I'll link here.. Category column disappears from Capabilities page. A comment with security level 'Developers' was removed.. Disconnect between Admin UI and nuget-hosted config. Noticed that when you enter in a ""?"" or space on creation of a repository in the Name field you get a validation Seems the validation message for ""bad"" names (vs empty names) is undefined. I checked all available repo types and it affects them all. The legacy repo message is For reference, not saying that should be the new message necessarily (tho it reads fine to me if true). This is new to CMA and does not affect older versions of NX3. Nor NX2.. A comment with security level 'Developers' was removed.. While testing NEXUS-8447, I was on System Email Server in Verify SMTP Connection popout and clicked to cancel. Doing so (with no emailed filled in) caused validation to occur. A second click closes the popout successfully. Having emailed filled in and clicking cancel also behaves correctly. I guess this is likely the same fix as NEXUS-8430. It's definately similar behavior.. Saw this after about 6 hours idling. Only once, seems different but unsure if related. FYI. Screen also showed attached message, which I don't recall seeing before. I know we have a countdown and expiry but this seems neither.. Log Viewer shows entire log despite size selection. While performing UX review, I noticed in System Information the Print window not scrollable (so just shows screen height worth of lines). This does occur in m3 (checked at Daniel's request) or in NX2.. A comment with security level 'Developers' was removed.. stray null appears on System Information load in IE11. On cancel, window does not return in full view sometimes. In the left navigation of IE11, when a main area is collapsed (via the - icon or by default) a + icon does not show to reexpand it. You can click on the blank area and it will expand. I left severity major because this is potentially confusing for any who are collapsed by default and or mistake. Borderline minor with the workaround. I've attached a screen of this working in not-IE from Daniel, which may be the easiest way to explain (since absence of +s is hard to point out, tho can be screened). I did not check older versions of NX3 at this time. This does not affect NX2 as there are no + - icons there.. While doing UX review, I noticed the below pages do not have Saving masks that the rest of the pages do. After speaking with Daniel we agreed on one ticket. Tasks - Settings (when saving a Task) LDAP (saving to create an LDAP) I did not check NX2, this perhaps is an improvement but not worrying about that now.. Some pages actions have inconsistant masks re: changes. Filing one ticket to update after speaking with Daniel. Staging Bundle - ""Upload mask"" appears to be the whole page not just the area.. A comment with security level 'Developers' was removed.. TestNote: Verified first two in case someone takes this over.. Use present instead of the current year in the copyright notice. A comment with security level 'Developers' was removed.. Subheader text contains redundancy with content. In NEXUS-7758, the capability details were merged from 4 areas to 2. One of the things that moved was the Notes (About) section. However, in the post-deploy, I noticed that the details area has a header ""Notes"" but the old details also have I checked with and we agree it's redundancy and can be removed. Because so much of NEXUS-7758 is working, filing a separate ticket to avoid failing the ""parent"" over something so small. See attached for how it is now (one example), if you need more or old screens let me know. Because of recent adjustment this is not an issue in NX2 or NX3-m3 (or earlier).. A comment with security level 'Developers' was removed.. On Login, Password appears filled in IE11. In NEXUS-7959 it was revealed ( 3) that you can double click column headers to expand contents to full width, giving this column ""priority"". I noticed when you do this with columns with shorter content (like Status) part of the words remain cutoff. I suspect this is because the column width includes the filter dropdown but the space for the contents does not (not sure tho, but that is how it appears). I did not check NX2 at this time.

While reviewing NEXUS-7959 ( 1), from Repositories I removed the type column then added it back (having the original columns there) and noticed that many of the columns, including the lengthy name column were super small. I am not sure if this was because of NEXUS-7959 but I definitely think the resizing could be better. On refresh, everything resizes correctly, but on refresh all the hidden columns are restored as well, so that doesn't really mean much.

Update: Seems the issue here is monitoring software looking for 50x responses. This change causes a steady stream of false alarms for some setups.

Any host matching one of these patterns will be reached through a direct connection instead of through a In short: if nexus uses it's own proxy configuration standards, it should not modify, nor use the system properties.. Need workaround for cases where trial installer cannot be run.. We've found that the Linux installer cannot always be run successfully. Typically causes of this are lack of X11 libraries (NXCM-4628) or strange http proxy setups. For cases where the installer fails we need a way to provide Nexus Pro + trial configuration without a full installer.

Known affected formats so far: all formats should be reviewed (and fixed where needed) for lack of attribute. In short, the setup: group, that contains two members, one proxy and one hosted. The requested metadata is contained in a proxy (but is also deployed on same path in hosted repeatedly). This setup group should never return 404, as the requested metadata does exists, even under load. Current code does not uses the fact that merged metadata content is and does an unneeded roundtrip to Storage that introduces concurrency issues with group cache.. NX3 proxy fetches more than should. Similar issue to NEXUS-8637, this case also currently results in HTTP 500 Internal Error, but should not. Downstream 404 Not Found is more appropriate, OR, in case of deploy, 400 Bad Request.. While the policy is enforced, the log gets an ugly stack-trace and response code of 500 Internal Error which is not acceptable. Response should be 400 Bad Request..

Example output (packages deployed by user ""deployment"" user are locally published ones):. As per registry spec, version descriptor objects are not mandatory, and a URL where to find them is allowed too (see registry root description or Package Root Object's version field).

Acceptance Criteria: On upgrade, latest pgp configuration will be converted to a capability Users will have to first upgrade to to get on latest pgp configuration. Update Shiro dependency to. Seems like issue NEXUS-5418 introduced even more as known, and it made ""Rebuild Maven Metadata"" defunct (unverified, as reported by user on HC). It caused a known inconsistency, that proxy repositories response on file retrieval of SHA1 (and MD5) files basically ""redirected"" response to main file (the file that asked checksum belongs to) and served the response generated for main item corresponding attribute. This does not happen in hosted or group repositories, but should. The problem reported by user probably stems from same change, as ""Rebuild Maven Metadata"", once you end up with wrong checksums, does not recalculates them, but restores the bad ones from attributes.. The ""?asExpired"" flag is meant to invalidate local cache and force a ""remote check"" for requested item. Still, it is getting blocked by NFC, if the item is not locally cached, but is in NFC.. Basically, similar (if not same) fix should be applied to it as was done here: Also, it similarly breaks Map contract as AppContext does.. See attached video. In short, with CLM configured, at Staging profile south panel, the ""CLM Application Management"" link is shown, but it leads to wrong URL (having CLM Brain responding with 404): Note the double slash (). Manually removing one slash leads to page okay. When no application selected, the ""CLM Dashboard"" is correct, leads to proper page on Brain.. FSPeer wrongly assumes is always a good candidate for tmp file creation. FSPeer wrongly assumes is always a good candidate for tmp file creation. This might not always be true (especially for non-maven layouted repositories, but even Maven layouted ones might contain such files, made by some custom Nexus plugin or external tooling). The code in question is here:. Consolidate logging levels in Nexus Core. Many log entries have wrong levels (INFO instead of DEBUG), and many of them dumps stack traces at unexpected levels (like stack trace dumped on INFO level). Chat about this at the very end of IRC. Rationalize Nexus Core dependencies and components. Core is currently bloated, and contains many ""key"" dependencies pinned in, that simply prevents plugin developers easy upgrades (to follow their own dependencies). On the other hand, key dependencies that are extensively used in key features like Maven Repository Support are moved out into foreign projects, pinning our core to depend on foreign release lifecycle, but also forcing us on ""compromises"" needed to maintain backward compatibility with other non-nexus integration for that 3rd party library.. Use downgradable locking implementation in Nexus. We have a fixed locking implementation available which should solve quite a few problems with the current If we're going to move to this implementation we should do it sooner rather than later, and should do an internal release of Nexus at least a month before the official release so we can get experience with it running on our servers. The change introduces ""downgrading"" of locks (in both, Nexus own and in wrapper wrapping sisu-locks). The use of distributed locks was already possible by a system property switch.. Artifact maximum age does not have any effect for proxied release artifacts (NEXUS-3069). However, the UI element for this is still enabled. We need to revisit the reason for NEXUS-3069 (and it's original reason NEXUS-3065), and if possible restore this functionality (since it breaks staging).

Docker search against group is incorrectly sorted. I uted a count query against the default repository, published a test package to nuget-hosted, and then re- uted the count query - and the count incremented. Reproduction: 1.

The expectation is that if a component is present in more than one repository, the ordering of group members will determine which one is returned. Presently we just return the first matching record, regardless of the configuration, although the query uted is indeed different. Given a hosted repository to which I've published a component downloaded from a proxy, both of these queries return the same result regardless of the group membership configuration: Similarly, browsing a group repository will show the same component regardless of the group membership ordering.

UI Component and Asset details page urls should be transportable. As a User I would be able to copy the link for the page I am looking at and share that link with someone else. noticed that if you copy a link for an element you are looking at details for, when you hit the bookmark it takes you to the base Browse UI page (selecting a repo). I verified this and the fact it does not occur for search, although likely will be an issue for any of our Drilldown views which require multiple levels of context during normal navigation. This is new to NX3 and NX2 is not browsable in this exact way (but is bookmarkable for the non-tree path version).. When checking to see if an index already exists the raw repository name is used, but elasticsearch stores indices in lowercase only. This leads to an exception being thrown on update as we try to create the same index again. Any repository created with uppercase letters can be used to trigger this behaviour; on an update from the UI you will be greated with a 'facet failed to start' message.. Looks like we're running into this issue: Rendering from here is including a micro character that doesn't render properly: Noted while reviewing this screenshot in a PR(note the question mark in the Processing Time):. Authentication Password should always be required. The new CMA default (host) repo creation has deployment policy set as read only. The NX2 default was dependant upon the release policy (disable redeploy for release, allow redeploy for snapshot, etc). After speaking with and this did not sound intentional so filing. These policies are new to CMA so no back checking of NX3 can be performed. Workaround to select what deployment policy is correct manually. This also affects the default NuGet hosted repo and caused me to find the related (linked) defect. UPDATE: - based on discussion during planning today we will leave the default as 'Disable redeploy' and it is already not read-only at this point.. Some pages actions have inconsistent masks.

I think we should decide which one is the default and go with that in both cases. Acceptance Criteria: - Set to true when default repos are created. If one is to add non proxy hosts - the tooltip (? icon) suggests regular expression Inserting a host with such format does not produce an error, but while having a wildcard '*' at the beginning of a hostname causes an error to show up in the console upon restart of Nexus.

Implement Raw Format Proxy Repository For New CMA. Implement a simple bucket of files that allows for any file to be shared, so that they appear to be a repository while preserving the path. This is the simplest of the repo formats in Nexus. Equivalant of Site Repository from Nexus 2. We did this because Maven uploaded files such as HTML to describe your repo. This allows for to be shared.. Implement Raw Format For Hosted Under New CMA Architecture. As a Nexus administrator I want a supported procedure to rebuild the npm metadata from existing npm repository storage, particularly from hosted repositories. This is useful for rebuilding metadata from rsynced npm storage in a failover instance and as a database corruption recovery tool. Notes: - Look into OrientDB backup, export as potential options if we can't rebuild. This has someting to do with re-using settingsforms bits which have this preset width. Acceptance Criteria: - Bring Change Password Dialog into being a consistent width with Login Dialog. Content from sources needs to be able to detect the type, by asking Tika and recoding this in metadata. Additional logic will also be needed to layer ontop to validate that content we get is what we think, to cope with issues like asking for a .jar file and getting a .html error page.

The list of capabilities specified in the appxmanifest has changed from to 10. Some of them apply only to one version or the other, and some of the new ones require the tags be namespaced. Right now our support is basically to allow a passthrough of XML from to the manifest to add more capability tags.

Windows: Phone App crashes after Splash Screen. Windows: The textAlign and verticalAlign property of the label is not working on windows phone. We currently have hard-coded to be on Windows 10. We should investigate how to get the full version string (doesn't the code that worked on Windows work on Windows 10?). On Windows Phone we use a Pivot: On Windows Store(desktop) we use a ListView. Just by how the macros fall, we use the same in Windows 10 Desktop and Mobile now. In the source we note we may want to use a SplitView on Windows 10: and I think we have the choice of all three on Windows 10, so we may want to see which is the best fit.. Our current implementation is ""turned of""' for because the API doesn't exist. The API does exist in Windows 10, but since I wrote most of the code before we started out real efforts, I did not finish it fully. We need to fully hook it up (particularly, we don't actually generate a ContactList on the Windows side when we do a so any operations on the js group returned won't work.. The bundled make in Windows SDK has a set of default assets it packages apps with. One of those is a temporary PFX key. However, they only auto-insert it if the app has no apps manifest, but we generate that. So we need to add logic that for not distribution targets that require PFX cert we should just use the temporary key transparently much as Visual Studio does. So for ws-local on and for wp-emulator, ws-local, wp-device on when no PFX is found, use this key and don't prompt.. Using this code: The textfield ""password"" don't mask the content if field is not editable. If property editable is set to true, the value is masked. Works fine on iOS devices.. Windows: Can't display local url on windows phone. We currently use macros that will effectively compile one block or another depending on whether the code works is available on phone or desktop. This is the right approach for Windows 8, but in Windows 10 a universal app is generated and the check must be done at runtime. We need to convert these checks into a macro and have the macro defined to do different things for versus 10. See and I think we can extract a simple macro like: We may of course need more variants for things where the API is now available in Win10, but was only available for phone or store on etc. Clipboard was only for in but is universal in 10). Windows: Convert (store or phone only) code to using macros to guard. When we target Windows 10 as the end SDK target for a user's app, we need to be sure we use the Win10 compiled SDK libraries.. We have separate builds of the SDK done against Win and Win 10. We need to package both versions up into a single zip that is used in the main SDK. We can't just mash together the two zips, as we need to adjust where the WIn10 builds get packaged up in the final zip. Right now they're under store x86 and store ARM. They probably should be under something like ""win10 x86"" and win10""ARM"" since they're supposed to be universal for Win10 store phone.. If we generate a native UI proxy (say an and add it to a Titanium UI, we don't properly clean up all the native proxies we've generated leading to a large memory leak. Specifically we need a way to track all UI proxies added as children in the view hierarchy and explicitly release them when the top-level native view is asked to release in our Java code. Be able to pass in some subclass of into Titanium methods that take subclasses. Once the V8 library is updated we'll need to do some significant work to update our native C++ code. There have been a number of large breaking API changes in V8 that we'll need to handle. See:. Add some mechanism to reference, include and use third-party libraries in Hyperloop JS code.. Android: Support usage of third-party JARs in Hyperloop. Support some syntax that allows users to implement a native interface in Hyperloop JS..

Tried doing this (had to use JDK8), and got the following: It appears there are at least a few issues to resolve.. If you're using native API access and create something like a you'd naturally want to set a text label for the button. But the Content property is a with the understanding it could be a String or it could be an UIElement (in fact it could be a UIElement, and if it's not then it's basically converted to a String though how that's done isn't really talked about). We need to understand this nuance of the API and support settings string values easily,. Windows: ti build failed when logo image assets with invalid dimension exits.

If a developer uses the native wrappers they currently cannot generate native UI components and then add those to a Titanium View Window, and vice versa. We should support the ability to wrap native UI widgets as when necessary, or unwrap native components to native wrappers when necessary. This is something Pedro's handles.. We have a version of hard-coded into the manifest templates. We need to pass along the tiapp version number to the manifest. From the looks of it, I think the best approach is to use the first two digits from tiapp, and then we should manage the last two. The 3rd one should be an number each build.

The property is meant to convey if the app itself is set up to do location services, so it's more a check if they've set the in their I'm not sure if we can query capabilities at runtime or not. We might be able to do a simple call to the geolocator and catch exceptions to know if this property should be true or false.. The docs we use to populate the parity report (or maybe just the parity report itself?) aren't including the Windows specific types we've introduced. Specifically, we have a set of types implemented, but not listed in the parity report. I also don't see them listed in the bleeding edge docs at The types are here:. Windows: Fire routechange event. Windows: Add windows module create command to the CLI. We should allow hooking and removing event handlers in a JS-like fashion and handling the conversion to the right native calls in native wrappers. We'll need to do some translation of event names and also mapping to various handlers event registration types that Windows uses, as well as wrap the added handler with a call to the callback function.. We need a mechanism as part of the build to crawl the user's app to generate the list of native types required. We may need to also handle ""dynamic"" requires and treat them as needing all native types. We can then use this list of types and their dependencies to trim down the list of included types we'd incorporate into the require and cast hooks from TIMOB-18878 and TIMOB-18879.. Implement the non create* methods: -beep -hideCamera -previewImage -showCamera -switchCamera -takePicture -vibrate. Windows: Allow casting to a different native type. We should allow the ability to ""upcast"". We could simply hang a ""JSObject type)"" method that is on all native wrapped objects and would take the new type name. Then we'd have a giant generated if else block where we test against the known set of type names and do the to ""cast"" it:. Windows: Stub module with constants, stubs for methods, no event firing.

When generating TableViewRow, the wasn't modified to add the include for the file.. We should use a fully implemented algorithm for our require implementation that generally follows the spec: Tony L has implemented on top of Titanium APis for and Jeff H implemented in Objective-C. We also had an impl in Hyperloop, all of which we can try and re-use leverage.. we seem to do this pattern a lot where we pull something out of a argument list, cast it, check the type via assertion, etc. this is a good place to come up with either an inlined helper function or a macro. makes the code more readable and has the advantage for developers to ensure we have a very common pattern for how to do this logic. From Jeff's review comments here:. I would create macro that does this instead: which would generate this: From Jeff's review comments here:. HAL: Create helper for common property additions to classes. Can't we come up with something like this: This would generate: Advantage is that we force a compile time pattern for the TitaniumKit defined interfaces and it's easier later if we want to change the pattern or add assertions or even compile this code out with our compiler because this method isn't used by the app. From Jeff's review comments here:. Windows: Need to support UTF-8 characters. Related to PR 12 ( Added new issue entry for this so that we can track this. We may need a workaround for Currently some unit tests are failing on Yosemite.

We package up an ini file into the apps with the IP port to use to connect to the CLI and forward logs.

The resolution is simple, it should set the in the generated manifest. Also take note of TIMOB-16356. The following code works fine on iOS and Android but will crash the app on Windows, :.

UIPickerView and UIDatePicker are now resizable and these views would enforce a default size even if you attempted to resize them. These views also now default to a width of 320 points on all devices, instead of to the device width on iPhone. Interfaces that rely on the old enforcement of the default size will likely look wrong when compiled for iOS 9. Any problems encountered can be resolved by fully constraining or sizing picker views to the desired size instead of relying on implicit behavior. Demo code: On iOS8, nothing should change and the height is ignored. On iOS9, the height should be honored and the picker should resize.. Via the new property behavior, iOS9 now allows keyboard input as an action on the lock screen. Reference: Sample code:.

Basically the 'spawn' uted (line 385) to detect the powershell, for odd reasons, never emits the 'close' event and so the process hangs. Skipping this detection, the build continue normally. I have described in more details the problem in the following post: Not sure why this happens, but I'm not the only one with this issue.. iOS8: not working properly. iOS8: KitchenSink: Views Options Dialog: Pop up does not show up on iPad. iOS8: Orientation: Screen gets distorted when orientation changes. In addition to the X and Y properties, views in the Android L Developer Preview have a Z property. This new property represents the elevation of a view, which determines: The size of the shadow - Views with higher Z values cast bigger shadows. The drawing order - Views with higher Z values appear on top of other views. We could use this instead of sorting the views manually like we do now.. The material theme provides a new style for your app, system widgets that let you set their color palette, and default animations for touch feedback and activity transitions.. description The developer's app includes a Ti module that wraps a 3rd-party library that uses the iOS Reachability class. It appears that APSAnalytics also uses the iOS Reachability class. Both the 3rd-party library and the APS system include this class in their respective libraries causing a duplicate symbol error during linking. Below is the error I get when manually building the app:. iOS: Duplicate symbol linker error when using APS. iOS8: Add support for Share Extensions. CLI: fails to build to device with Android.

The reason why is because we don't put the directory inside the app root directory like we do for iOS. Instead, it's in an adjacent directory to the app root directory. In other words, it's however it's not accessible because apps can't leave the app root directory. There's no way for an app to access module assets from a Titanium app. The only way I've heard is you have to use write another module that effectively proxies the assets. It gets worse, modules paths are not namespaced like on iOS. So if has a file called and also has a they collide and only one of the files will exist. Yes, this is really bad design.

Related to TISTUD-998, right now in Studio you can select (some of) the properties of an AVD (Run- Run Android Emulator) but this isn't configurable enough for some cases (although you can modify an AVD created by Studio in the tools, as long as it has the right name). It would be nice to have the feature to select a pre-existing AVD in the run so that you can use an existing AVD without having Studio create a new one for you. It appears to require build script modifications allowing for the specification of an arbitrary AVD.. Android: JSS with import and js with include files not working. iOS: Support building to device, directly to the device, skipping iTunes. When building to device, it would be good to build directly to the device rather then building, then having to sync via iTunes.

Android: Add compiler warning when using maps with Non-Google APIs SDK. iOS: fieldCount is a property beginning in Update Anvil, KS, etc.. iOS: searchHidden value does not stay when window containing scroll view is blurred focused.

The problem is that if the only place you have the text is in a comment comment), Titanium does the same thing, and fails to install with the message, .

There is a very simple fix to this already out there in the wild, see I would recommend that change is made to all appropriate UI controls which have a toImage() method. Please remember this issue is only visible when using an iOS 4 Retina Device..

To demonstrate this, follow these steps: touch (delete all files and folders within build android) after successful app launch, replace code above (does not contain maps) with the code below (contains maps) not cd (delete all files and folders within build android) no improvement is observed when the app is relaunched any number of times * once the file is touched, a ""Detected change, forcing full message is output to the console, and the app is launched as expected.

Nor does there seem to be a property to enable it. The cancel button IS animated when a searchBar is attached to a tableView. iOS now has an optional argument in setShowCancel, of wherein the cancel button is animated in its hiding. If Android offers something similar, we probably should support it for parity's sake.. When using the modal style, iOS by default does not dismiss the keyboard even when text fields are blurred. iOS and later allows us to override this, but this property is not currently exposed.

Debuggin on iOS device is a multi-step process (listed in TISTUD-2090), and before we implement the wizard idea, we should improve the message we show to the user after we started step 2 and are waiting for user to complete step 3 once iTunes finishes syncing. The suggest message is ""Waiting for (the app is being installed to iTunes; when iTunes finishes syncing, please launch the app on device for the debugger to.

Validate project name for projects. When creating projects with enabled, we need to validate the name. So far, I know that are not valid for projects. So for Titanium Mobile, we need to check the only if is enabled. For a standalone project, we need to add a check for valid strings. An alternative would be to format the project name so it's valid for an nettle ""new"" command. I'm not sure what the implications are. Note: There may be other strings that are not valid h3. Suggestions For existing projects, if a appears in the name, prompt the user to pick a new name. Alloy templates are similar to rails preset set of files, more a set of commands to run to generate a scaffold.

Remove the text in Windows installer about restarting the machine after uninstallation since it is not necessary. Add support for creating javascript modules to TiStudio. This assumes that the project has not created a local repo or the local repo has no remote. Right click on a project Team Create on Name of repo Description of repo Organization you wish to publish to Public Private radio button See for information on publishing a new repo We should be proactive about seeing if we can test if a user has rights to create a repo within an organization, and if they have rights to make a repo private so we can alert them before the creation process.. -Replace the textbox with a combo box that contains the list of keystore certificates -The certificate added from the Browse button should automatically add the certificate to the list -New button will trigger the same keystore dialog as before. I don't think we need to modify the existing keystore creation dialog. We just need to allow user to select an existing one in the wizard as described in TISTUD-1612.. Add radio buttons to the dialog that allows the user to specify either an existing keystore from the disk or adding a new one. If an existing one is selected, we need to have a password field but not others.. Unable to format file generated by Titanium Mobile Web project.

Remove the latest SDK from the mobile SDK directory if it is already downloaded; 2. Start Studio. Expected result: Studio will show a popup on the lower right corner indicating there is an update available, and clicking on it will show a release note dialog and then start downloading the latest SDK. Actual result: Studio will start downloading the latest SDK right away after launching without any user interaction, and no release note dialog is shown..

Titanium Studio: MobileWeb: Packaging: allow packaging to non-existent directory. Steps to reproduce: 1. Create a Single Window project from template wizard 2. file URL, and evidently it does not work that way. It is probably easier to extend Studio than to fix this behavior in Mobile Web. Suggested fix: * When creating a new project as part of the mobile web packaging wizard, create a new default server for use in preview and associate it with that project.. Kevin, I believe your comment is meant for TISTUD-1269 instead.. The Mobile Web ""browser preview"" launch configuration uses some separate settings for determining which browser to launch. Instead, we should have a drop down respecting the current browser settings in preferences: If user selects to specifically choose a different option than the global settings, have a drop down with the following options: System browser Browser 2 * Have a link to open the preference page for users to manage the settings. If any launch configuration fails because a browser setting has been removed, fall back to an external browser using the system default.. Indicates the outline is out of date when there is syntax error in the code. This is related to TISTUD-1000. Currently the domain information is only needed during login, so it makes sense to add the domain field to the ""Already have an account radio"". The default gray text should be something like ""Specify domain if desired"". If the login fails because the domain isn't satisfied, then the domain field is required..

Studio: Installing new SDK from CLI causes Blackberry and Tizen to gray out. Package Alloy Geocoder sample in Studio. Currently for Alloy samples, we call ""alloy new"" to create the default app and then unzip the sample content on top of it, but for Geocoder sample in due to the complexity related to ALOY-891, we decide that it will contain the full-fledged app in a zip, and we will define the sample using our existing sample extension point..

Ubuntu Unity: alert user for the issue where menu won't show inside Studio. Studio: Profile as iOS device - ""Waiting for profiler to connect"" message window does not disappear as it should. Studio hangs when trying to Project Explorer view. Add a toggle entry in launch shortcut pulldown to not auto-run when one is selected. After TISTUD-5666 is implemented, global toolbar will automatically launch it. We want to provide a toggle menu item where user could modify the behavior to not auto-launch on selection. The toggle should be available in the launch shortcut dropdown and in all modes, and it should apply globally to the workspace..

Configuration: iOS - ""iPad"" appears in the iOS simulator configuration when profiling or testing on iPhone simulator. Missing run menu item on Windows. Add to the global toolbar dropdown when package mode is selected. We should have a option in the global device profile dropdown for when package mode is selected as we had under Publish icon in the local toolbar of Project Explorer. There should be a separator between it and the shortcuts, and it will launch the run configuration dialog instead of select it as an entry.. Default Android emulator is launched when using older version of the TiSDK with Studio. Run on iOS Device: add list of devices to the launch config dialog. With the new capability of launching directly on iOS device provided by CLI, we will need to update the launch configuration dialog to include the list of devices to. In the output of ""ti info -o json"" for CLI it will contain a section ""ios"" ""devices"". We should display this list in place of ""iOS Device"", and when one is invoked, pass the id value in the flag to ""ti build"" command.. We should have a ""Run option in the global device profile dropdown as we had under Run icon in the local toolbar of Project Explorer. There should be a separator between it and the shortcuts, and it will launch the run configuration dialog instead of select it as an entry.. 1. Open Preferences Studio Themes; 2. Switch Overall Theme to ""Dark Studio"" and switch back to ""Light Studio"". The Project Explorer view will then become unreadable due to text. Have to restart Studio to get it display properly.. In the output of ""ti info -o json"" for CLI it contains a section ""android"" ""devices"", where it contains info such as id, name, model, and manufacturer. We should display this list in place of Android Device, and when one is invoked, pass the id value in the flag to ""ti build"" command.. Quitting Studio from the login screen hangs indefinitely. Investigate if loading tiapp's Build Properties section needs to be improved, and if so, move the time-consuming task to non-UI thread.. Profile TiApp editor for expensive operations that should be run on non-UI threads. We should run a profile session on opening TiApp editor and locate the bottleneck. Once located, we should move those operations to be run off the UI thread and have some indication to say the tiapp is loading.. It is unlikely user would use Studio to browse local filesystem, and Titanium development is very much project-based, so we should remove the node for Studio. We will still keep it for Aptana Studio.. The feeling is App Explorer doesn't add compelling value and feels redundant next to Project Explorer. We will hide deprecate it from default Studio perspectives but keep the plugin.. Studio freezes for a moment when loading Deploy Targets section of tiapp editor. We have each mode broken out as it's own pulldown menu. We should adopt the UI where there's a giant ""play"" Run button that is pulldown to toolbar of App Project Explorer.. 1. Delete Global Appcelerator NPM Packages. 2. Install Studio. 4. Run Studio and accept npm package updates. Result: The updates are locally installed to a folder other than the one studio was run from. See screenshot. Expected Result: The updates are globally installed. Note: If you try to run studio commands that require the npm packages, they will fail. Studio looks here no matter what (and the commands fail): Workaround:. UI blocked during install of Selected Platform SDK. Make npm packages required installs and not allow user to dismiss required installs. Mobile Web configuration: load browsers info in the background when platform config wizard is opened. Platform Config Wizard: Align the start of text in settings section with the platform entry. The screenshot shows the left bound of settings section matches with the checkbox. The suggestion is to match it with platform name instead. If that causes too much space on the left visually, then we will revert to implement based on this screenshot.. Platform Config Wizard: create a gradient effect from the platform section to its settings section. To improve the background transition from the main platform section to settings section, a suggestion is to add a gradient in the middle.. The gradient didn't look great when implemented in Eclipse, and the new icon on the left does help to indicate which platform the settings section belongs to, so marking this as invalid.. Make the Advanced Settings text and arrow right-aligned Move the arrow to the right of the text Modify the text to say ""Settings"" when collapsed and ""Hide"" when expanded Make the status center-aligned Remove warning icon for ""Not Yet Configured"". Formatter fails on javascript braces block. Currently the wrench icon appears on the left of platform checkbox, while info icon appears on the lower right. Since the two are mutually exclusive, only one could appear at any time, the suggestion is to line them up on the same side.. Platform Config Wizard: Display the EULAs for selected platforms in separate dialog. Currently the description just says ""Select platforms to configure"". It doesn't really add more information to the title in explaining what the wizard does. We should improve the message. A suggestion: ""Download, install, and configure required SDKs for the mobile platforms you would like to develop. Platform Config Wizard: modify the status when we finish configuring a platform. When we finished configuring a platform, we should update the status area to display two lines: the regular check mark and latest installed version on top, and the installation location below. The Settings text and arrow should remain hidden. If the installation is canceled, we should show ""Canceled"" status but without any icon.. Related to TISTUD-5326. For iOS, currently there is no Advanced Settings section, and the visual indicator will appear in its place, making the UI feel inconsistent. The suggestion is to line it up on the right as indicators for other platforms are.. Platform Config Wizard: iOS: move the visual indicator for downloading to the right-most column. Android: Emulator: Enable Fastdev for SDK. Loading iOS provisioning profiles: Improve the error message when CLI is not found. If the CLI is not installed or if it is installed to a location that is not in user's PATH, user will run into a NPE when the provision profiles are loaded. We should better handle such cases.. If user selects an unconfigured platform, disable ""Finish"" and enable ""Next"". Make next page be the install wizard page. Filter that page down to only the selected platform. When user finishes wizard we'll install the unconfigured platform first, then create project. If a platform fails to install we'll need to prompt if it's OK to create project with that platform and let them know how to install it later through tiapp editor?. We currently disable unconfigured platforms in the listing. We should enable them, and the severity of all about them not being configured should be reduced to Info icons.. The second point will no longer apply after TISTUD-5322 is implemented.. The preference page of Android does not react immediately to user actions. For instance, - Takes long time to open the preference page. - If Configure button is clicked, then it takes a long time to open the dialog that shows the list of Android SDKs. - It takes a long time to initialize the status based on the new SDK location.. The Configure button currently opens the dashboard. With the platform configuration wizard implemented, it should open the wizard instead, with only Android item checked by default.. Platform Config Wizard: Investigate the steps to setup Tizen on various OSes. We will host the necessary Tizen on our server (TISTUD-5245). However, we need to figure out if we can install silently into a specific location (preferred), if we have to run the installer for users and wait for the completion, and other potential unknowns.. Once user clicks ""Configure"" with Android respective URLs. The progress dialog should indicate the proper progress since we have the control on the process.. This is an extension of TISTUD-5246. When the wizard is opened, we should check if Tizen is already installed in the default location or if the preference page already has a valid SDK path set (meaning user has configured it either through the wizard or set the path directly in preferences). If so, we should display the installed version next to the platform checkbox instead of ""Not Configured"".. This is an extension of TISTUD-5243. When the wizard is opened, we should check if BlackBerry is already installed in the default location or if the preference page already has a valid SDK path set (meaning user has configured it either through the wizard or set the path directly in preferences). If so, we should display the installed version next to the platform checkbox instead of ""Not Configured"".. This is an extension of TISTUD-5242. When the wizard is opened, we should check if Android is already installed in the default location or if the preference page already has a valid SDK path set (meaning user has configured it either through the wizard or set the path directly in preferences). If so, we should display the latest installed version, Android next to the platform checkbox instead of ""Not Configured"".. After user selects the platforms and clicks ""Configure"", we should provide a progress dialog where we indicate the progress on individual platforms. User should be able to put it in the background or cancel the operation.. In the platform configuration wizard, there should be an entry for Tizen, and it should contain an expandable ""Advanced Settings"" section where user could set a path for the root Tizen SDK location. It will be filled initially by a default path, The text next to the checkbox should say ""Not Configured"" by default. This ticket just covers the UI aspect. There will be separate tickets for dealing with the actual configuration once ""Configure"" is clicked as well as auto-detecting if Tizen is already installed in the default location to update the UI state accordingly.. In the platform configuration wizard, there should be an entry for BlackBerry, and it should contain an expandable ""Advanced Settings"" section where user could set a path for the root BlackBerry NDK location. It will be filled initially by a default path, The text next to the platform checkbox should say ""Not Configured"" by default. This ticket just covers the UI aspect. There will be separate tickets for dealing with the actual configuration once ""Configure"" is clicked as well as auto-detecting if BlackBerry is already installed in the default location to update the UI state accordingly.. In the platform configuration wizard, there should be an entry for iOS. It will have an Advanced Settings section to customize the Xcode location. By default, the location should be filled with and the text next to the checkbox should say ""Not Configured"". This ticket just covers the UI aspect. There will be separate tickets for dealing with the actual configuration once ""Configure"" is clicked as well as auto-detecting if Xcode is already installed in the default location to update the UI state accordingly.. Field Service: In description of Field Service Sample in Dashboard we should state to read the ReadMe to configure. Allow create Alloy Application Templates using Rubles. h5. Problem description After hard restarting the system (for everything was completely frozen), Appcelerator Studio was not starting anymore. After launching it and choosing an existing workspace, the login screen didn't appear - only the red Studio Splashscreen was being displayed. Here is the console details: h5. Workaround After deleting the folder, Studio would start correctly.. Appcelerator Studio: stuck on the splash screen when restart. Run Configurations dialog: create new iOS Application Installer config failed with exception. Add Alloy navigation shortcuts to the Project Explorer. Support optional comma in tss file. LiveView: Remove the launch configuration contribution. Remove the contribution to applicable launch configurations for enabling LiveView as we will be using the global toggle to control the setting. For existing launch configs, we should ignore the liveview attribute and also use the global setting.. Add a toggle button in App Project Explorer toolbar to enable disable LiveView for the next run. This will be a global state to control if the next applicable launch (run on iOS Android and at the moment) will be run with LiveView on or off. Initially the button is toggled off, and the workflow is as followed: 1. User toggles the button on and do Run iOS Simulator, the simulator will be run with liveview; 2. User toggles it off, do Run Android Emulator, the emulator will be run without liveview; 3. To run the iOS simulator without liveview, user will just do Run iOS Simulator again since now the setting is off.. When a tss file in Alloy project is Alloy project.. When a js file in Alloy project is Alloy project.. When a xml file in Alloy project is Alloy project.. Studio: the Plugin zip does not exist on the update site. No menu items appear under when an invalid Android SDK path is set in preferences. It's nice that we are now providing additional info on why a platform is disabled in new mobile project wizard. However, the position of the error mark is misleading. For example, in the screenshot attached, it's easy to think Android and Mobile Web are having configuration errors, not BlackBerry and Tizen. The error mark probably should be after the platform name, and hovering over the disabled text should also show the reason.. NPE in the log when getting the latest SDK release while Studio is shutting down. Can't terminate iOS Simulator process from the console. iOS Packaging Run Config: 'Upload debug symbol' checkbox deactivates 'Run' option. This does not occur Test Steps: 1. Package iOS App (Ad-Hoc or iTunes). 2. Goto Configuration New Configuration and select the 'Upload debug symbol option' Actual Result: 1. 'Run' option is active before selecting the 'Uploading debug symbols' checkbox. 2. 'Run' option is disabled after selecting the 'Uploading debug symbols' checkbox. Please refer the attached screen shot for further clarification.. BlackBerry: Allow BB project creation with spaces in the app name. should not allow create a method with space in the name. Could be fixed after TISTUD-4744 is resolved.. When manually terminating a debug session by clicking on the debug-stack threads (the ones that say ""Remote node and ""JavaScript Thread""), the launch state is not terminated. This forces the user to manually click the launch, and hit terminate again, before allowing the launch to be removed from the view. We need to terminate the launch when terminating the thread.. BlackBerry: cannot run the created package or device launch configuration from configurations dialog. 1. Create a BlackBerry project; 2. Run Publish Distribute - BlackBerry; 3. Open Publish dialog; 4. Select the created Titanium BlackBerry Packager launch configuration if it isn't selected. Expected result: ""Run"" button should be enabled to run the launch config without any change since there is no error. Actual result: ""Run"" button is disabled. The same behavior is observed on device launch configuration as well.. Binding: disable OK button in import binding dialog if nothing selected. disable OK button and add a message on the reason when the input matches the current cname. Added an image of Xamarin installer and a screenshot from OSX Installer wiki page for a couple of examples of installer on Mac. The bullet points for us would include something similar: license, prerequisites destination, installation, and summary.. Embed Git check and install into Studio Windows installer. We currently include portablegit and prompt user to install at Studio start if no git is detected. Portablegit is for not just git support, but we also use it as our shell environment for Windows (terminal, getting shell env, etc). For the new installer, we should embed the git check and installation of portablegit in it.. Modify Studio Dashboard to invoke the new platform config wizard for configuring platforms. We currently have links in each platform section under Get Started tab to direct user to individual site for downloading the natvie SDKs. We should modify them to invoke the new platform config wizard with the specific platform selected.. Liveview: Fastdev prevents liveview from working on android emulator. This involves moving the launch shortcut and related classes for contributing the Run Android Device action to Android's own plugins.. This involves moving the launch shortcut and related classes for contributing the Run BlackBerry Device action to BlackBerry's own plugins.. Samples: double-click should expand folder node in Samples view. Summary log from chat recorded on poker session Story Time Chris Williams: I'm secretly in UK Thomas Huelbert: lol. Only prompt user for overwrite when installing a Titanium SDK that already exists. Dashboard: Mobile Web Configuration is not getting configured. Dashoard - Marketplace: clicking on the link doesn't open the page. Include PHP related rubles in the PHP feature. Include Ruby related rubles in the Ruby feature. The following rubles should be packaged in the Ruby feature instead of the Studio core feature: Capistrano, Cucumber, EngineYard, HAML, Heroku, Rails, Rspec, Ruby, Sass. We have an extension point to define a path where bundles are contained. Check plugin and for an example.. Move all references of BlackBerry from the mobile and core plugins to BlackBerry plugins. Once all the subtasks of refactoring the BlackBerry code into its own plugin is completed, all the references of BlackBerry from the mobile and plugins has to be either removed or moved to BlackBerry's ui core plugins. All the constants, resources and utility methods corresponding to BlackBerry should only be available in BlackBerry plugins.. Move Publish Distribute BlackBerry action to BlackBerry plugin. This involves moving the definitions and related classes for contributing the Publish Distribute BlackBerry action to BlackBerry's own plugins.. Refactor the modules table section of to have BlackBerry plugin contribute its column. The plugin will need to contribute the icon. We also need a mechanism to parse out the module version for BlackBerry to be shown in the table. Is the platform type enough, and the tiapp model could parse the directory structure from there?. We should have a subnode for each platform under Preferences Studio Platforms and move the respective section from Platforms preference page there. The plugin will contribute the BlackBerry preference page and handle its preference settings.. Move Run BlackBerry Simulator action to BlackBerry plugin(s).

Titanium Studio visual interface does not show common js modules such as the amazon Titanium AWS module can be found here: It is installed sibling to the commonjs module in the commonJS folder After this is installed the visual editor does not show the module as available. it can be manually entered into the file and works, however the visual interface does not show it PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING TICKET: there is a bug that is direct conflict with this request:. Description: While attempting to set a browser before running a mobile web preview, I noticed that the list of browsers did not include any specific browsers except firefox. It would be ideal to populate the list of installed browsers rather than have the user populate the list manually. Steps to reproduce: 1) Install Studio 2) Create project with mobile web target 3) Run in browser 4) Select ""run and use the browser selection section Result: Firefox is the only 3rd-party browser listed although I have Chrome, Firefox, and Safari Expected: Firefox not displayed, or all installed browsers displayed Note: The version of the browser is displayed here as part of the name of the browser.. Improve accuracy of Testflight publish progress indicator. Studio: Local variables do not appear in content assist. Titanium Studio: Multiline Search: add ""Select All"" command to select all to search and replace boxes. When clicking on text in the search or replace boxes, it is difficult to select all the text. Steps to Reproduce: 1. Open studio, create a new project, open the file. 2. Open search bar (command + f on osx). 3. Copy paste a larger block of code in the search box. 4. Attempt to use the ""Select All"" command to select all the text Expected Result: All text in the box highlights. Actual Result: Select all doesn't work.. h4. Problem Description I published an App to the App Store and Google Play but the app never appeared on ""My Apps"". The original guid was: Because I noticed new projects showed up on ""My Apps"" I've created a new project and transplanted the guid to the of my app. Released it to the Play Store and this enabled the app to show on ""My Apps"" where it says ""122 analytics events were processed for this application since May 1, 2012"" but it still shows 0 users, 0 sessions and ""There were no events logged during between 5 7 and The new guid is: I wrote more about this in but haven't received any feedback. Can you take a look?. Currently, the default studio workspace is Titanium Studio Workspace. Because the workspace contains spaces, Android modules cannot be packaged. One suggestion is to change the default workspace to one without spaces to facilitate module development. As per discussion, it was suggested to use:. Android modules created from command line cannot be packaged in studio. There is no package option in the UI. Note: Android modules created in studio, and iPhone modules created from the command line, work as expected. Steps to Reproduce: 1. Create an android module from the command line. 2. Import the module into studio. 3. Attempt to package the module box icon Package Android Module). Expected Result: Package option should be available. Actual Result: Package option is not available. h3. Suggested solution When importing an existing Titanium project, check for the existence of a file, and set the appropriately.. With support for JavaScript (commonJS and MobileWeb) modules being added, we now need the ability to display and select javascript modules in the TiStudio Modules panel. Show the modules In the popup to select per-platform versions, for commonjs modules, only show a single drop down for selecting a version which will apply across all platforms.. Add ability to log out of Jira account for ""Submit a ticket"". Right click on a project Team Share GitHub Name of repo Description of repo Public Private radio button See for information on publishing a new repo If we allow a user to clone from organizations, we should also allow them to push to organizations. In that case, there is a slightly modified flow where we would need them to pick an organization first, and then we make a different call if pushing to an org.. I would like to be able to log in to my Github account and save my account information, possibly in our new ""Accounts"" preference page. Store: Password Additional buttons links: Sign up (to sign up for Github, which directs to the website). Similar to other platforms, support the creation of BlackBerry modules. We don't yet know exactly the steps involved.. The new Blackberry simulator utilizes a VMWare appliance. We'll need to launch against that. Improvements: Add IP address override to launch configuration (see TISTUD-1597 for root IP specification) Add password override to launch configuration (see TISTUD-1597 as well) Steps to use the integration: Launch VMWare Device Find out IP of device. User enters this in the main preference page, or in the launch configuration Run launch script, passing in IP address, password as arguments: required optional, for devices. Add a dashboard controller when given the URL to a module .zip file, installs the module to the SDK location on disk. If for a specific project, update the file (equivalent to what we do now when packaging a module for local distribution). Fail Titanium Studio build if plugin is missing rubles. In TiStudio open the file of an app with the GA, and click 'Enable'. An app is created in the cloud services. Click it again and another app is Suggested fix: Check to see if the file is dirty. If yes, alert the user that enabling cloud services will save the file. They can then choose to proceed, or click cancel. Enable cloud services. Save the file.. Using the dashboard search bar or the top ad link (""Reach Million Appcelerator Developers"") launches in a generic browser with no controls, providing difficult navigation. To address this, we'll need to switch the code that launches the browser in this case to be the same as the other cases on the dashboard (all other links open an external browser, and that appears to work correctly). it's a matter of triggering a portal action instead of using target "" new"" as part of the href.. Fail Jenkins build if Studio contains JDT plugins. Trailing semicolon after curly brace in conditional causes error in JS formatting. Steps to reproduce: 1. Create a new .js file in a project 2. Copy the following code and paste it into the .js file 3. Press on mac to format the pasted code Actual result: The following error is generated in the log file: !ENTRY 4 0 !MESSAGE (Build Error while formatting the code in your editor. Please submit a bug report through Studio's support and include the relevant code which triggered this error. Expected result: The code is formatted correctly. It appears to be that last trailing semicolon. Delete that, and it works.. If the current set of release notes is from a full HTML page that does not contain a , the release noes will launch in a new browser window. Allow for override of as a command-line option to make testing this easier. First try to grab apidiv. Then try to grab interior of body node, or if no body node, then whole content. If either work then replace release notes template with new content. If all else fails, use whole content and don't use the template. Notes: Anchor links didn't appear to work (might need to be munged?). After first loading Titanium Studio the template HTML Expected results: Should see a list of all available templates for HTML files. Actual results: Only a strange entry and the HTML 5 template appear.. When creating an application in ACS, we need to pass the GUID along with the call. The format will be: ti guid , passed to the call.. Use built-in ANT when packaging Android modules. Created a new Android mobile module project Attempt to package the project Run into this error: snippet of code: final Process osProcess It appears it can't find ANT. We package ANT as part of Studio, so we should instead use the built-in ANT rather than calling it on the command line. Workaround: Right-click on Click (the first option). When using the Android NDK, if you have spaces in your path Studio Workspace), Studio will fail to be able to build an Android module project. Suggest putting up a warning when creating a mobile module project warning users about the issue and informing them how to solve it (direct them to the wiki page on how to move switch their workspace:. Replace with accordion. Initially open a section to configure TISTUD-1456 perspective ** See APSTUD-4798 and APSTUD-4799 for actions to call The bottom half of the accordion is similar to what we have currently If we reduce or remove the top toolbar, we may wish to surface some common initial configuration options to the first tab of the equivalent to an initial questionnaire. It could be perhaps in some normally ""hidden"" area for ""advanced configuration"" if we determine it's useful but is confusing on first run.. An exercise in simplifying the new user experience: Create new ""Studio"" perspective add keyboard shortcuts commands for ""occurrences"", ""block selection"", ""show whitespace characters"" remove outline view remove servers, problems, terminal, console view ** keep console view hidden unless an error comes up. Studio: Build Participation: Windows does not update content assist for new class methods in Javascript. Packaging of Android module fails to copy built module to destination. When creating a mobile module project, we should be more strict about the name validation and the module-id validation. module-id should follow the Java conventions for package names (just like we do with Android).. When packaging to a non-existent directory, an error is presented and the user cannot package. Steps to Reproduce: 1. Create a new project. 2. Package for mobile web. 3. Create a path using a new sub-directory hand-typed. Expected Result: Should be able to package app and new directory is created. Actual Result: Warning prevents app from packaging. Suggested solution: Don't show warning * Pop up error if issue creating dir. Remove option to launch Mobile Web Preview in internal browser. The studio internal browser may not fire touch events to mobile web apps. Steps to Reproduce: 1. Create default app. 2. Preview in internal browser. 3. Click on buttons. Expected Result: The app should respond to click events. Actual Result: No response. Works on the other external browsers. It apparently sometimes works on some machines and not on others. Based on feedback, it appears there is some conflict between Mobile Web and the internal browser. Thus, the best option is to remove the ability to use the internal browser.. We'd like to make it easier for users to extend and contribute to the Titanium Desktop (TIDe) project. Refactor the current Titanium Desktop plugin(s) into a new repo We can remove references in the plugin, since the update process will likely be much different in the future Do we need to create the concept of a Titanium type desktop, mobile, ?) that would contribute a few things into the system Add a feature enabling users to install the plugin separately on top of Studio Create a hudson build to build this plugin and push it to a deployment site Change the license of the plugin to Apache 2 See attached image for dependencies.. Description: While attempting to set a browser before running a mobile web preview, I noticed that the list of browsers did not include any specific browsers except firefox. It would be ideal to populate the list of installed browsers rather than have the user populate the list manually. Steps to reproduce: 1) Install Studio 2) Create project with mobile web target 3) Run in browser 4) Select ""run and use the browser selection section Result: Firefox is the only 3rd-party browser listed although I have Chrome, Firefox, and Safari Expected: Firefox not displayed, or all installed browsers displayed. Add ability to read packaged rubles from the Titanium SDK directory. Add platform attribute to module element(s). Clicking ""Publish"" multiple times when package application for distribution on Mobile Web results in an error. Summary: When an application is selected to be packaged for distribution on Mobile Web, an error is shown Steps to Reproduce: 1. Create a new project 2. Click on the Publish button and select the option for Package Mobile Web 3. In the pop up window, select the third option for Create a new project for the new mobile web app 4. Put in a project name and click on Publish (do it at least 2x quickly) A packaging error is shown with the message ""Failed to package project"". Unable to preview mobile web application when launching preview of page. Unable to locate module when launching Mobile Web application. Studio: Kitchen Sink Nook not available in samples. Steps to reproduce: Create a new Titanium Mobile project Put a breakpoint on one of the ""var"" declarations in Launch the iOS simulator When debugging stops on the breakpoint, note the error as shown in the screenshot. Application ""null"" has been packaged message when starting a server. Trying to open the from an FTP server returns this error: This caused the attached logfile to be generated in the Titanium log. Steps to reproduce: 1. Create a Titainum Mobile project. 2. Upload the Mobile project to an FTP server. 3. Attempt to open the Actual result: An editor opens showing the above error. Expected result: You should be able to open the but it will be treated as an ""external"" so some editing options are disabled.. Remove as Android SDKs requirement for Android development. Add Titanium platform support info in CA for Titanium namespaces. Currently, we warn users about not installing Xcode Once that support is in, we'll need to remove that warning: new text: We also need to update the sdk info links for the Xcode download to. Please try running the same command Titanium Studio does on the command line: Do you get the same result?. Change Studio to reference new platform -clean option. Once TIMOB-7652 is complete, we'll need to switch to using that mechanism over the current one. Note, this only will work on SDKs above so if the SDK is less than that version, we need to use the old system for now.. Our current JS CA implementation queries the index file for the entire project. This means that we show content assist for all JS files in a project when bringing up CA in a JS file. We now detect ""require"" invocations and store the required module name in the index. We also have the ability to filter index query results by a list of documents. Using these two items together, we should be able to filter JS CA by required files only. Note, that we may not want this as a default behavior for web projects. So, for the time being, we should implement this for the TiMobile nature only.. Using the sample snippets in the Epic containing this ticket, we will need to create documentation that shows that code being scriptdoc'ed for use as a module. We need to update the wiki pages here: *. Suggest we may wish to keep ""Edit Profile"" available ( as that is the third link currently available of and also currently present on the dashboard.. The available packages in will change names and pricing of those will be on a per-app basis. Hence a paid subscriber might have more than one package, so we can no longer display the user's plan level on the dashboard. Instead we should just display the following: a link labeled ""My Account"" pointing to the user's account. Titanium MobileWeb when previewed against an internal browser shows empty content. Description: Currently the configuration utility performs a check of iOS platforms to see if is available. From what I've been told this is non-exclusive, meaning would be shown to satisfy this check, but with coming out, the upper bound needs to be corrected. 1) Evaluate the logic here: 2) Note the iOS platform check as including and < Result: Only iOS SDKs would meet with success Expected: Logic evaluates based on target supported iOS SDKs. At the top of the ""Register Existing"" and right below the ""Publish"" screen dropdown, add the following text: ""TestFlight allows developers to publish beta builds of applications to a group of users organized into a This might need to be contributed as part of an extension point or interface.. Create test plan for module additions. It appears Xcode has changed the location of developer tools. In particularly, it's packaged as a single application, with the platforms and command-line tools installed underneath. Homebrew has a function that finds the proper path prefix: no longer seems to be installed by default, so note that we have to have a fallback here Else check if Developer exists. If so, use that. Else ask spotlight where Xcode is (mdfind if that succeeds, append to that location. Type names missing from JavaScript hover. We moved the SDK check to for demo purposes. Revert this back to by Titanium Studio GA. Add ""release notes"" overview to Titanium SDK update dialogs. As in Studio we previously prompted for user updates with a custom dialog box containing a browser pointing to a remote URL containing the latest set of release notes, similar to this: but formatted differently. I've attached a screenshot of how 1Password does it, which seems fine. Ideally, this dialog would follow clicking on the yellow toast (though note the case where we had both a SDK and a Studio simultaneous update should handle that gracefully) The SDK and Studio dialogs will be identical, save the URL in the middle. However, we only do the SDK update dialog right now, as we completely control that process.. We can fix the issue, but it seems that the command-line SDK should have an option to clean. Added linked ticket for that idea.. Add XSD-based Validation for and editors. CSS ""Add Color"" Command places the caret before, not after the inserted color. Please see capture at : Upon invoking the CSS Add Color command, the editor places the caret after the new color code. Steps to Replicate : 1) Open Titanium Studio 2) Open a CSS file 3) Select Color CSS Add Color Actual Results : The caret precedes the new color. Expected Results : The caret should be after the new color.. Error in log file: ""Was unable to add folding position"". JavaScript validation continues to report a syntax error, even after error is corrected. 1. Import KS from Samples 2. Compile to device 3. Without cleaning compile to iphone simulator We semi-solved this with TISTUD-697, but we missed a case.. Currently there isn't an way to delete an OpenShift app from within Studio once it is created, and if user runs into issues with creating a new app, exceeding the limit for the number of apps per namespace or trying to create one with one that already exists, and would need to delete an app, they would have to go back to command line with gem to resolve it. Perhaps add a command (using Rubles) for OpenShift to delete an app (by typing in the app name). Allow snippets to be scoped by project type. Have this code in a JS file: The result of this CA is: In this case, the Titanium Mobile ruble is contributing a snippet which does not apply inside a regular JS project. Suggest is we have some way to allow snippets to be scoped based on project natures titanium mobile), or perhaps a more generic mechanism jquery snippets enabled in a ""jquery"" project, where there is no corresponding nature) Suggestion is to add a meta scope of:. Titanium Studio: Improved error reporting in preferences window for invalid Android SDK. Create test plan for Snippets view. Warn before launching in if there are errors in the project. If i type bad javascript and compile, it's not always apparent from the logging what the heck is the issue. We show parse errors in the gutter of the editor and in the problems view. If the project has errors, we pop up a dialog as shown (similar to JDT) warning the user of the error and confirming they wish to continue. There also needs to be a way for the user to reset the preference warning (suggest a single button to reset all checkbox preferences, not one per preference). When developing an Android module, you either need to set the ANDROID NDK environment variable, or set in the of the module Marshall suggested instead that when packaging we call ANT directly (instead of the module build scripts) and pass to the scripts. We can get the preference from TISTUD-952. To test: Create a new Android modules Set the NDK location Package the module. If it succeeds, the test is successful. Incorrect packaging would result in the build failing and prompting a user to specify the NDK path manually.. Force installation of Android NDK if user is doing Android module development. Unsure how to have a conditional install, however, the user does need to have the Android NDK installed before proceeding with building an Android module. Suggest the following: Add the NDK to the file. Locations are available from Download from that website Perhaps install the NDK under the chosen SDK directory, android ndk? Create a Android NDK Home preference in Preferences Titanium Studio Titanium Test for this preference being set when creating an Android module. Update dashboard with new tests Add NDK line in Titanium preferences. As demonstrated in , for some reason some browsers, in certain circumstances, will not download files with filenames that contain spaces. Please consider renaming the Windows and OSX install packages in to Update to respect the new names. Paul, I'll leave this one to you or Chad to close.. Show error in problems view if a project has an incorrect configuration. Run git clean on build subfolders during project clean. Anytime you do a on a Titanium mobile project, the and directories have any existing files deleted. This is bothersome when those files are the easiest way to ensure that the and paths exist when storing a project on git. If they don't exist, a user attempting to build the project will get an error on their first attempt. It would be ideal if, when a is performed on a project, that any existing files were left untouched in those directories. Running a git clean should restore the project to the state it was check in with.. Rework info message for 'native' and 'implements' from Mozilla JS validator. In my JavaScript source code when editing in Titanium Studio, if you use the words 'native' and 'implements' as function names, it gives me a warning of a syntax error in the syntax highlighting, but everything compiles and runs fine. This is because those items are future reserved words. We should rework the messages as , and say something like ""Native is a future JavaScript reserved word. Its usage may not be compatible with all JavaScript runtimes"". Currently, when Studio first runs, a ""configuring python interpreters"" dialog comes up. Instead, we should integrate this dialog withe the current dashboard configuration process. It would allow for checking and configuring Python interpreters through the Dashboard configuration actions. Add check for python configuration to current dashboard check * If check fails, add button that pops up the same dialog as shown now. Note that for Aptana Studio, this would require us implementing a similar dashboard as Titanium Studio so that we may perform the same checks there.. Add dashboard support for checking GIT (windows only). Configuring GIT should be allowed on a Windows OS through the installation of Portable GIT. Add check for git configuration to current dashboard check * If check fails, add button that pops up the same dialog as shown now (which ultimately does the installation) Note that for Aptana Studio, this would require us implementing a similar dashboard as Titanium Studio so that we may perform the same checks there.. Change ""Deploy"" tool tip to ""Publish"". For clarity of terminology, please change the tool tip for the ""deploy"" menu to be ""publish"". This better fits with the current usage of that menu and the items inside. Correct references to ""Deploy"" in wiki documentation. We should be opening the file after we generate a mobile module project, as a means of getting users started more easily.. Open file in editor for user after generating mobile module project. Add preference for default settings on android run debug configurations (API & Screen size). Add Support for debugging on Android devices (tethered). we have the following issues open for ios and android to add debugging support for device Enhancement request - Add Support for debugging on device once these are addressed studio would need to add UI to support the features. This ticket is only for the Android side of the equation. The task here is to agree on a discovery mechanism with platform. It might be that we pass the IP address Studio is listening on to the device, or we might have the device broadcast and Studio would listen. After that, the rest of the process is identical to the current mechanism. Additional ADB info:. Cannot right-click on a folder in project explorer. Add unit tests for SDKLocator, SDKManager, SDKEntity classes. Allow users to add new platform targets after project creation. h1. Feature Support specifying the ""Abstracted LCD density"" of an Android Virtual Device in the ""Debug Configuration"" in Titanium Studio. Also add the field to the Titanium preference page to support a default value. Right now, only the API, Screen, and Log level can be changed. By adding this additional field, it would be easier for developers to test multiple densities. h2. Associated Helpdesk Ticket. Allow a ruble to contribute the image for a template. Outline window doesn't always show javascript object outlines for self-invoking functions. Replace colons in project names with underscore characters. It currently shows Aptana, Inc when hovering over the installer image. Would be 5 points if it is already in correct format.. Update the verified publisher in Windows installer to Appcelerator. Change ""Install Titanium SDK From to ""Install Specific Titanium Add radio button: Install from Update stream: Cascading drop-downs ""release"" stream: (filter on OS) ** ""continuous integration master"" stream: (we may need to work with platform to either a) regularize the format or b) allow for the extension point to apply some regex xpath to the JSON to grab build info). Create new Titanium Studio Splash Screen. There is a placeholder image for now but needs replacement. We can replace the existing size, or use a new different size, but we'll just need to configure a few new options:. Add iframe for Ad Content to screen. Retrieve content for frame from similar location as in TiDev. Assume some static content for offline mode.. Create Appcelerator studio error reporting strack trace model. Subtask from TISTUD-7697: The wizard suggests that you select the targets here but deselecting doesn't affect the actual listed targets in the It just determines the choices given in the next step. So the wizard should either remove the unselected targets (and populate this list by reading the available targets in the Xcode project) or it might as well skip this step and show the next step right away for all targets. It completely make sense and keep everything in one page, as we hardly have 2 targets.. Eclipse can only send errors, similar to that, we should identify our own error patterns from studio.. Identify the error patterns from Appcelerator Studio. Prototype Error reporting feature with Appcelerator Studio. Update with the new version * URL:. If you run ""npm ls -g appcelerator"" when a pre-release version is installed, ""npm ERR! code 1"" is returned. If you run ""npm ls -g appcelerator"", ""npm ERR! code 1"" is returned. does not occur Steps to reproduce: Actual: No error should be returned when you run .. Installers: Update with the new version. Windows Installer: Installer should install NodeJS on a clean machine. Appcelerator Studio Windows Installer should install NodeJS on a clean machine.. Add prominent display of ""what you like what can be better"" to solicit feedback. Help Studio Submit a Log in Fill out fields Error reported is: ""Field 'versions' cannot be set"". Since the update of studio (and even before the updated XCode 7 had finished downloading - I still had the previous XCode installed), no simulator ""option"" appears in the launch pad area (see graphic below). No amount of reinstalling (done this twice now) is helping. I can confirm that there is indeed a simulator resident at: and then after showing package contents, in: Shows as per the 2nd graphic attached. appc ti info also reports simulators: Help! UPDATE This problem is only apparent on ALLOY projects.. OS X installer should check for and install correct version. Launching creates a new process without killing the previous one. Failed to publish to MobileIron: No message body writer has been found for response class. Marketing needs to swap out the OpenX javascript code on Ti Studio home tab to the following js code:. When testing Studio, it is difficult to tell what build is included in the installers. Viewing you can't tell what version of Appcelerator Studio is included. 3 suggested changes: Output the version of Studio being packaged in the installer build logs When building the installer, create a companion file called That file is uploaded to On add hover text over the installer links to highlight what version is published there (for those who need to know). If you import a Titanium project with ACS enabled, you will be prompted to change or leave the existing keys. But the choice is not clear. Create a project with ACS enabled; need to use Titanium stack (Titanium Studio: CLI: SDK: Note the ACS keys in the Next, in Appc Studio, open Studio dashboard, , and select You will be prompted to replace keys, but the dialog is confusing.. Import: ACS - Improve UI in Prompting Dialog. Once the download of the prerequisites or studio starts there is no way to stop the installation. For the studio, once the installation starts only the back button is enabled which allows the user to go back to the previous steps but no option to cancel installation unless force quit is attempted. So it would be good to have a cancel button to allow the user to terminate download once it has started.. Studio: Mac: Options relating to Windows projects appear in Studio on Mac. Sign OS X application with ""Version 2"" of developer signature. From Apple: Beginning November 1, 2014, apps submitted to the Mac App Store must be signed with signatures created with OS X Mavericks or later (v2 signatures). Apps without v2 signatures will be automatically rejected on upload. If you build code with an older version of OS X, use OS X Mavericks or later to sign your app and create v2 signatures using the codesign tool. Structure your bundle according to the signature evaluation requirements for OS X Mavericks or later. Considerations include: Resources should not be located in directories where the system expects to find signed code.  *. BlackBerry: Installing through BlackBerry SDK through Studio does not install Momentics correctly. MobileWeb: Unable to launch mobileweb projects in Android Emulator. Android Modules can not be created in Windows machine. But module can be created using CLI. h5. Steps To Reproduce 1. Launch the studio on windows machine 2. Create an android module h5.

We should be able to navigate the user from usage of a translation key string to it's definition in an i18n file. This extends the previous functionality from TISTUD-6692: If you hold down Cmd and hover the mouse over the titleid attribute for first label, or L() macro on second label, They are not turning into hyperlinks.. When a project under the organization: studio, it starts creating the project and then when it is more than half way in creating the necessary folder, it hangs. However, project is successfully created under organization. Steps to reproduce: 1. Go to File New Project 2. Enter Project Name and select organization as 3. Click Finish Actual Result: Starts creating the project and then when it is more than half way in creating the necessary folder, it hangs. When the red square beside the progress bar is clicked it stops but the 'new project wizard' cannot be closed. Studio then becomes unresponsive and it has to be forcefully quit. Expected Result: project must be successfully created.. Clearing invalid proxy login, still does not allow the user to login to the studio and shows a message that the server is unreachable. This is not a regression as it also happens in Appcelerator studio Steps to reproduce: 1. Click proxy set up 2. Enter the following in the proxy setup host: 3. Click ok 4. Enter your credentials and login to studio the proxy settings 6. Login to the studio Actual Result: 4. ""Login server is currently unreachable"" message is displayed 5.

Add hyperlink detector to jump from i18n translation keys in Alloy View XML attributes to their definition in files. Windows: The installer is not able to install GIT from our URL. Studio: Studio does not recognize the previous Titanium installation directory after upgrading to. Windows: Alloy compiler does not show error details. Appcelerator Studio license link leads to Titanium Studio license agreement. If special characters (',' or for instance) are used in the keytool wizard then the keystore will fail to generate and an error popup will appear. Showing a warning in the wizard if any special characters are used might prevent users from seeing this error. To Reproduce 1. Publish an Android application and use the wizard to generate a new keystore. 2. In the 'Organization name' field, use a special character (Appcelerator, 3. Create the keystore Result Since this is an error with the keytool generator and nothing on Studio's side we should display a warning that specials characters will throw an error. Result Error is thrown with Java exceptions displayed on screen.. Appcelerator Studio: Incorrect message on the progress bar after enabling services. 1. Install the Appcelerator Studio version mentioned in the environment using the installer. 2. After the installation is complete launch Studio. Result: 1.

Check version strings from the browser settings vs the versions in sdk info and return results. Check the version strings in the name vs the versions in sdk info. The version string is appended to the end of the browser name. Return a similar success value to iosSdk with and. If on Mac or Windows, run the configuration in TISTUD-1414 and TISTUD-1738 if there are no browsers configured (if not, you would notice no browser names have version s attached). Related to TISTUD-1414. As discussed, we need to include the version of the browser in question as part of the browser name (see image for example) Ideally, this value would be dynamic, but that appears to be impossible given the current UI. In the case where the user upgrades the browser later, the suggestion is that when the user re-runs the configuration step to auto-search, we replace the version s of the existing browsers with the newer version. firefox -v. Create build participant to auto-compile embedded ACCS service when changes occur. For an integrated project, where the client and server are the same thing, we need to update the bindings for the embedded service when the service changes Watch for changes in the file If a change happens, re-run the compilation step to update the bindings.. By default, the first item in the first group is selected, and the corresponding description is shown. This should be the ""Alloy blank"" template for Titanium Mobile projects, assuming they have alloy installed. We have a way of defining groups or categories of templates, but there is no user-friendly name for them such that it could be displayed to the user. Add something that would allow us to group templates as shown in the mockup.. Add button to call new action to run project created in above step (APSTUD-4801), greyed out until a project is created, or there is at least one project in the workspace. If the user happened to close and reopen the dashboard, the ""just created"" project might be lost. So, we always run the most recent project based on timestamp.. See for more information.. If on Mac and Windows, the check described in TISTUD-2187 will be run on dashboard open with the other platform configuration options If there are compatible browsers, indicate the user is good to go If there are no compatible browsers, or you are on Linux, indicate the set of required browsers.

Expected Result: Each update is installed one by one, and user enters password for each.. Titanium Updates: inform user all updates will be installed on studio launch. Titanium Updates: Unhandled event loop exception after installing updates. Android Device Debugger: empty project console view appears. A comment with security level 'Developers' was removed.. When studio first starts, the npm is not prompted to install if it is not installed, this will prevent Alloy, CLI, and ACS from installing. Note this is not a typical use case and npm is assumed to be installed along with This is an improvement that would make studio a bit more robust. Studio Error Log: Steps to Reproduce: 1. Uninstall npm delete npm folder from node modules). 2. Start studio. Actual Result: No prompt to install npm. No prompts to install alloy, acs, or titanium, and no future updates for those node modules. Expected Result: Prompt to install npm if it is not installed.. NPM: npm install not validated on studio startup. Android Emulator: Application Installer abnormal process termination. Process exit value was 1. When a project is run in Android Emulator, the process terminates and the emulator fails to launch. When the same command is run from the command line, there is an error. This does not occur in Studio this is a regression. correct studio command for comparison: broken studio studio command: console error: Steps to Reproduce: 1. Run a project in Android Emulator. Actual Result: Terminate, no launch. Expected Result: emulator launches.. When a project is run in iPhone Simulator, no simulator version is passed in, so the process terminates and the simulator fails to launch.

At this point there is a failure due to related issue, will go away in future. Actual Result: No error messages. Expected Result: Should have error message.. Help: add mechanism to display cli alloy and node acs version installed from studio. Titanium Studio-ubuntu & new project top bar text is not properly aligned. Titanium Studio console output fails to display device output. Steps to Reproduce: 1. Create default project, add sample code (and breakpoints): 2. Run 'debug' on Android Device. Port forward message should appear on console. 3. Launch app from device. Actual Result: Titanium Studio console fails to display the console output. Expected Result: Titanium Studio console should display 'INFO LOGGED'.. In the Android debug on device wizard, add a checkbox that states ""Use previous build"". If it is checked, the build parameter UI is disabled and the user can proceed with the wizard. Doing so will re-use the last used app associated with the launch configuration. Allow Android debug session without app re-build. Steps to reproduce: 1)Open Titanium Studio. 2)Open Create a Titanium Mobile project - Android device. 3)Click on 'debug' icon- android device. 4)Wait till process completes. Exit from debug perspective. 5)After sometime th the bottom ( Ti studio task-bar launching previous project is displayed) screenshot attached. Actual result: Launching run project gives wrong notion to the user.. If a titanium project contains a service, and the user selects project right-click New, Service appears as a menu entry. As a further complication, when New Service is selected, the New Method dialog is invoked instead. Steps to Reproduce: 1. Create a titanium mobile project. 2. Right-click New Service to create service. 3. Right-click New again. Actual Result: New Service exists as a menu item when the project already has a service. Expected Result: Menu item should not exist. 4. Actually click on New Service. Actual Result: New Method dialog is invoked, which is not correct. Expected Result: Either a new service should be created, or a dialog indicating a service already exists.. In Project Explorer, if there are no projects, the Publish icon is still active (regression), however no entries are available (correct). See screenshots. No log info. Steps to Reproduce: 1. Open Titanium Studio. 2. View the Project Explorer. Make sure there are no projects in the explorer. Actual Result: Publish icon is incorrectly active (but no list appears when clicked, as expected).

Actual Result: Titanium Studio console log fail to display the console output Expected Result: Titanium Studio console log display the console output.. TiApp Editor: prompt to save when focus leaves tiapp editor. When Preferences Titanium iOS Configure button is pressed, nothing appears to happen. In reality, the dashboard is opening in the background to the configure page. I would recommend using the Configure button for the same action it would perform if launched from dashboard. h3. Steps to Reproduce: Go to Preferences Titanium iOS and click the Configure button. h3. Actual Result: Dashboard configure opens in the background. From a usability perspective it appears as though nothing happens. h3. Expected Result: Either the button isn't there at all because it doesn't appear to do anything, or it opens a wizard that would normally be opened using the dashboard (if possible).. Android Preferences: configure button fails to launch android installer. In the Titanium preferences, if the Xcode path is too long, there is no way to view the full path because the text field is locked. There is no way of knowing which Xcode is being used. This blocks testing. See Screenshot. Steps to Reproduce: 1. Open Preferences Titanium Studio Titanium Xcode Path. Actual Result: If the path is too long, it will be visually truncated, without the ability to reveal the full path. Expected Result: Some mechanism to view the full path.. Android Device Debugger pointer is not pointing to the current lines. Build: running titanium project causes No enum const class error. Launching Android Emulator in debug, or iPhone Simulator w o debug mode prompts error message.

Once the user presses the ""debug on device"" command, pop up a dialog that shows the four steps: Sync to device (iTunes) Connected Suggest having a wizard page that appears when launching. The page will describe the four steps (1-4), and can help to resolve any setup issues.. Once we have a XSD for we need to validate the UI elements in the TiApp editor against it. Doing so requires: replacing whatever possible for the current validation scheme in the TiApp editor with the XSD validation.. We should support that for iOS. h3. Run iOS V1: V2:. Add CLI command support for packaging a MobileWeb Titanium Module. Add CLI command support an Android debug launch. h3. Debug Android V1: V2: h3. Notes We need to make sure that FastDev is supported by the new CLI. Add CLI command support to run an Android project. We should support that for all platforms. h3. Run Android V1: V2:. Add CLI command support for building a mobileweb project. This one is only for V2 The Python implementation in V1 does not support a building command. We should try call ""build"" again when we've cleaned all our projects and build automatically is checked. The platform does not support incremental builds, so that call should probably only happen when a 'clean-build' is performed.. Add extensions for the CLI commands that create a Titanium project (mobile module). h2. Project Creation V1 (Python): V2. Add CLI command support for creating a project. Tested on Titanium Studio, build: Still can't see newly created projects in the Analytics Apps. The strange thing is that the first app I created appeared, while any other app did not. Tested on release and on development and it acts the same.. Create a mobile-web project (with Titanium SDK Right click to run the 'Titanium Mobile Web Previewer'. An internal browser is opened, but the page is blank. Right-clicking and viewing the source shows lot of code there, so we have the content, yet it's not rendering. Selecting the launch (via the Run and editing it to run on external browser works fine.. Once we have a XSD for we need to validate against it. Doing so requires: build participant to wrap calling the XSD. In order to create a better validation experience for and files suggestion is to create a XSD for them.

Actual: The application stops on the We need to make sure we only send out the relevant project breakpoints and not everything. If that's not possible, we can hook to the same area we hacked for TISTUD-4669 and skip breaks that we cannot associate with the actively debugged project.. (Note: This happens on only) Create a new Mobile Module project. Select the iOS option, hit 'Next' and 'Finish'. The wizard dialog hangs, and an error appears in the log.. Remove the 'Clear SD Card' option from the BlackBerry's Simulator launch configuration dialog. Right-click on a resource should display ""Debug - Local Server"" (like the run as), and should create a debug launch configuration on and launch. Existing launch configurations for the same projects should be re-used.. Adapt Google's ChromeDevTools ""Standalone V8 VM"" launch configuration to our needs. Rename it to debug as 'Local Server'. Make sure that the launch configuration delegate creates a local server with a debugger flag and runs it. Inject the server's port into the newly created launch configuration. Continue with the Google code launch as usual to connect to our local server.. Create a new source map extension point. Create a new source map extension point that will allow a contribution of IJSSourceMap contributors. Also allow prioritizing source-map contributions, so we could potentially contribute several mappers in the future. Each contributor should use the source-map mechanism to map back and forth source paths and line numbers. See TISTUD-3753.. Hookup standard output (stdout) to Console for BB10 apps (see description). Similar to TISTUD-2944, where we updated the alloy update style sheet, we need to do the same for the modules update style sheet. Right now the text in the module details is large and not consistent. The module JSON file should be updated to direct a release-notes page. This page should later be read by the release notes system and be applied with the same stylesheet we use for the rest.. TiApp Editor: Titanium SDK List Not Updated Until TiApp editor Restart. Make the server Run configuration private. The discussion stemmed from parity on having Run Run menu for project. We decided to implement the following two things: 1. Make the launch configuration for running local server private; 2. Add ""Edit Server under Run menu to allow user to edit the server settings such as port number. NOTE: For now, this ticket only deals with making the launch configuration private. Doesn't look like there is a point in controlling the ACS server port number when the project launch is ignoring it anyway ;) New tickets will be created to deal with the other issues.. Set the ""platform"" property as 'optional' at the plugin element in tiapp XSD. When performing the debug on Android device using the wizard, the status will be displayed as the app is built and installed. When the 'Start app' step is the current step, we need to remove the step control and replace it with an animated gif of an app starting on a device..

466,tistud,nle,"This was found in the course of testing TISTUD-1527. Steps: 1. Open dashboard 2. Right click (on a link) Open in new window Expected Link is opened in a browser based on the Eclipse Studio settings Actual Link is opened in a new external generic browser with no navigation controls This is currently only occurring on Windows, but an implementation change will affect osx linux as well. Module installation should not allow modules to be corrupt. There's one console line before the two you listed that specifies the alias, can you include that line?. This is related to TISTUD-1817, where we tracked down the locations that opened up a Message dialog from a background thread. A more elegant method of displaying the notification is to use a popup toast to notify the user. The popup should only be used for INFO messages, for Question and Error we should still use the Message dialog Locations that this affects: project packaging module packaging (normal and deploy to project with changes) -Titanium SDK update -Publish -Android SDK update (dashboard). Add a Preference page to manage Keystore certificates. We should adopt the Adobe AIR certificate management UI. See attached for Adobe AIR cert. management UI in Studio (we can probably reuse this code) There should be a new Android preference page (similar to iOS), that contains a table of current keystore certificates, and an Add and Remove buttons.

Package the module Expected results Module is packaged Actual results: NPE in the AntRunner and this following error (Build returned: 2 returned: 2 Caused by: returned: 2 at Source) Method). Update method to explicitly pass in PlatformType, output location and publish target. For the xcode-select command must be run to ensure properly function of the iOS platform scripts. Running the command can be foreign and difficult for some users. We should display a informative description and link on how to run xcode-select. There should be a linked wiki doc page that describes in further detail on how to run the command. The description should be included in the iOS section of the Titanium preferences. It should state: ""If the desired Xcode installation is not displayed, you will need to run ""sudo xcode-select "" to target a specific installation. More details"". Currently, if a user has both Xcode and Xcode installed, they would have to manually ute xcode-select to switch the Xcode version used for iOS operations. I propose we do the following -Update the Titanium preferences for IOS SDK home to be a combo box -The combo box contains a list of detected Xcode locations -Upon applying the changes, we call the sudo xcode-select -switch command. Running package operations (on multiple platforms) on the same project multiple times causes errors. Since package operations are now public launch you can run multiple configurations in quick succession. This will cause errors since the package operations operate on the build directory. We should queue up the launch configurations so they are sequential, scheduling launches based on the project. Steps: 1. Create a mobile project with iOS, Android and mobile web deployment targets 2. Perform project package for iOS 3. Perform project package for android 4. Perform project package for mobile web 5. From the run shortcut, re-run operations multiple times Expected: Each package operation completes successfully Actual: Error occurs. The wizard banners should be consistent with the action icons iOS Distribution Wizard Mobile Web packaging Wizard See attached request document. Currently the color scheme for the snippets view on Windows (tested on XP specifically) is not consistent with the other Studio views. See attached screenshots Background colors need updating Disabled tag buttons are not painted properly Hover over the tag buttons has an outline Snippet popup toolbar bg color has incorrect border colors. We have a a few icons (as detailed in the attached document) that need upgrading as they are not in keeping with they rest of the Studio UI. In general, they should be a bit more and colorful. Debug Icon * icon. Refactor the Android wizard page contents so it can be reused in the Launch configuration tab. Add a launch configuration for ""Install on Android Device"", which allows users to specify a android sdk. With the introduction of the Snippets View ( we need update the existing snippets to add more context and improve This is accomplished by adding the following fields to Snippets ( category: A name of a category used to group the snippet with other similar snippets. Optional tags: keywords that describe the snippet. Used as means to easily filter snippets. Optional Example: In addition is the entry that defines a grouping for snippets: These additions will make working with snippets much easier for user via the Snippets view The changes are also outlined here (towards the bottom):. Implement the new in Rubles: 'UI Elements' do s end Update bundle view to display categories. Snippets view should honor the theme settings. This applies to theme colors, invasive themes and invasive fonts Snippets view requires two new images - Insert snippet and Navigate to snippet source. These will be provided by our creativity engineer. Add appropriate listeners so the snippets view displays the appropriate contents A selection listener will listen to cursor location changes, and updates the snippet contents to match the cursor context. If there is a mismatch, the snippet is shown with greyed out colors A Bundle listener will listen to bundle to keep the snippets view contents in sync.. Support dragging a snippet from the snippets view and dropping into a source editor. The snippet is inserted at the drop location, and tabstops and cursor locations are honored. Snippet Preview Popup display information about a snippet: Snippet name, scope, and triggers - honors theme colors Snippet expansion contents - based on content-type settings Toolbar to perform additional actions - Navigate to source action (opens the contributing ruby file for modification of the snippet). Each Drawer contains the name and the count of snippets in the drawer Each snippet in the drawer displays the name and description of the snippet If the snipppet has tags, the tags are displayed in the snippet as a list of actionable buttons (buttons will filter based on the tag name) Each snippet has a toolbar with actions to perform on the snippet. Update Snippet Elements in Rubles to support Description, Category, Icon and Tags. The following attributes were added to a snippet element: description (String) - description of the snippet category (String) - category for the snippet icon path (String) - path to icon file tags (list of strings) - tags for the snippet.

During the startup of Studio, it appears to hang for a few seconds while it is trying to load show dashboard. I think Dashboard needs to re-worked (either calling the services and caching the portal action results in the background) to improve the performance of its startup so it does not hang the Studio UI..

Some console logging calls with array args do not print array to console. The cases are: ) and This does not occur in MobileWeb or Android. This is a parity issue. This does not occur to other array printing calls in iOS. This is an internal inconsistency. Steps to Reproduce: 1. Run code: Actual Result: Expected Result: There are issues with both the old python and the new CLI with how the multi-line strings are outputted. When we fix it, we should make sure it works for both CLIs. Keep the focus in the editor when console generates error output. Debugging on Device is a multi-step process, and we should guide the user through the steps.

The page will describe the four steps (1-4), and can help to resolve any setup issues.. When debugging on device, Studio launches two launch configurations (see screenshot). This makes it confusing to the user since the first launch configuration (Install on device) finishes and terminates, and another launch configuration is launched. There should only be one launch configuration and it should contain both the app installation and debug processes. Currently the my modules ""Update All"" button is disabled, since we don't currently support installing multiple modules.

469,tistud,cwilliams,"Set ""JS Editor"" as default editor for files. Can ignore for the moment.. The JSON style files specify style information for an app. We can provide CA for the property names, and also possibly common values similar to CSS CA. Need XML file containing CSS style information for the JSON configuration. See. For Alloy XML files, it is a file with XML tags, Need XML file containing tag information for Alloy tags. See. As an example: You would then define a controller named and you could automatically bind events inline in your controller code: So, we would need introspection on the items defined in the XML and display them appropriately in the content assist for the JS files. Right-click app models folder Pop up dialog box asking for model name, with a small table below for adding new values types For example: Add keyboard shortcut for opening dialog and generating widget (so user isn't forced to go through UI to do this action and can do so by keeping hands on keyboard).

Associate Alloy JS Makefile files) with our JS editor. What is the alloy JSON style configuration custom file extension we need to associate with? Does our JSOn parser editor handle the non-standard ""expression"" syntax?. Associate XML editor with files. It's currently unclear if the work needs to mostly be done on the Studio side or the SDK side. In general, we would need a source map to connect the generated source code with the original source code so that users could place breakpoints in the original JS files and have it break appropriately.. Hide Resources folder - Alloy generates the intermediate files there, most of the app lives in the ""app"" folder Long-term: - perhaps we root Alloy projects on the ""app"" folder, and choose an alternate presentation structure like Package Explorer. - What additional folders do we need to hide?. Creating Alloy projects inside New Titanium Mobile Wizard. Creating a new ""blank"" alloy project is as follows: - Run regular Titanium Mobile project creations scripts) - Run 'alloy new to run the alloy generators - Add Alloy project nature (in addition to the titanium mobile nature, web nature) By default, a new Titanium project is an Alloy project Note that an Alloy ""template"" likely would already have all the generated files, so we shouldn't need to do the script utions (running titanium scripts alloy binary). Need a new Alloy project nature to tag projects with (and with which we can hang new icons, etc, on). Need icons for Alloy project nature. Move Template selection to front of project wizards. We move project template selection to the first screen in the project wizard (see Xcode for an example here) This allows the user to focus on what they want to create (blank project, game, rss reader, master detail, We then ask the user to fill in the later. (Basically swap the first and second page in most project wizards).. The determination of whether or not this needs to be run under sudo may not be easy for us to determine.

Add a command with F3 binding to jump to of translation keys in other files in a Titanium Mobile project. This is simply a matter of defining a command with binding and handler, and then reusing some of the same implementation we have for the hyperlink detector.. Add data-binding attribute to Picker element.. We now can pass in auth for a given URL to our download manager (see TISTUD-6702). We need to break apart the utility method for installing modules to download and install separately and allow for passing in the auth in the download portion so for Mobware we can pass along auth to download the SDK zips.. Add hyperlink detector to jump from string keys in i18n files to usage in view files. Support content assist for curly braces syntax in bindings: we should provide CA for title subtitle after the period.. On clean installing the Appcelerator studio through installer, it creates additional folder Studio which contains an empty ""0D804B5"" folder. The actual installation of the product is in Studio"". Installing Studio dependencies fails when user has never run sudo before. Move Nukona out to it's own repo. We allow adding a node acs service underneath an existing project (definitely Ti Mobile projects, maybe any project nature?). When we do this we have a command handler which eventually call acs new.

The preferences page for the JSLint validator used to have an open text field for setting options using JSON. It no longer does. Users can still set options using *jslint comment directives in their code.. If a user adds a new remote but doesn't perform an action that would actually fetch or hit the remote, git doesn't ""grab"" the list of branches at that remote. When a user adds a remote through studio we can pass a flag that forces an immediate fetch to help alleviate this.. Now that we can generate pull requests in Studio, it'd be nice to see the list of open PRs against a given repo and select them to merge the PR. We need to hook a menu extension to show the listing of open PRs and merge the PR when selected. (The user could optionally supply a commit message, but I think for a first cut we just send no commit message and they will likely generate a default). List open pull requests for git repo attached to github, selecting PR opens in browser. Login to Titanium Studio. File Restart. Actual are not getting attached..

Add 16x16 and 12x12 icons for Windows Phone platform. Define the pref page id, pointers to the 12x12 and 16x16 icons for modules table.. Add the preference page extension, add a preference page that includes a path to the windows phone SDK.. Add extension stub (just basic name ""Windows Phone"" id ""windows""? - check with platform for the id they'll be using sdk support check) (core). We have a handful of FTP and SFTP plugins. I'm not sure if they're advertised or used much by Titanium Studio users. We may want to break out an S FTP feature (and repo?) to move them to, build them separately and then include them under the Aptana Studio umbrella so they don't get installed in Titanium Studio by default, but only in Aptana Studio (like we did with We already have the S FTP library in it's own feature and build. It would likely be combined with the following:. Move BlackBerry preference page to blackberry UI plugin. Re-order the Test items under the main Run menu. We only show the user's personal repos in the listings. We should also look for the repos they have access to from their organizations.. h5.

The plugin will contribute the iOS preference page and handle its preference settings.. Move Run iPad Simulator action to ios plugin(s). This involves moving the launch shortcut and related classes for contributing the Run iPad Simulator action to ios' own plugins.. Refactor the Deployment Targets section of to have ios plugin contribute its entry. Refactor the Titanium project wizard to have ios plugin contribute its entry. In XML, if you invoke CA after a ' ' we suggest attribute names, not values.. In HTML, if you type ',"", we auto-pop CA. That isn't the case for XML. We should make it do so (mainly for alloy, because normal XML doesn't actually have any proposals).. Once the user is able to set the path to the NodeJS source folder we need to be able to index it to get the details of the core modules under lib. These are straight JS files, so we can index them using our current mechanism. This should be treated like a 3rd-party library that can be attached to JS projects (much like an external JAR for JDT, possibly even just attaching ""Node"" to a project entirely which would be like attaching a JDK so it attaches the core modules form source and the $NODE PATH from the binary install).. NodeJS's core modules are defined in JS files under the lib subdir of the Node source package. This is not installed when the binary is. If the user has a source package on their system, we should allow them to point to it so we can look up those core modules. This would involve setting up a preference constant to use as the key to store the path, as well as the UI fields to set edit it in the Node preference page (which already exists and has a field for setting the path to the binary install).. We need to provide content assist for the list of property names for a given element in TSS files. is the token we'd suggest. We should take the string which is the key of the surrounding object, convert it to a fully qualified type name (see TISTUD-2783), then query the list of properties for that type. If the string is not the name of a type, but is a class or id, we need to query the class id index from the view files to resolve it to the type it is hanging off.. Provide content assist for property names in TSS. We need to offer up content assist for the keys of the JSON-like objects in TSS files. This ticket specifically addresses offerring up the list of classes and IDs found in the view files. The token is what we'd suggest. IDs use a prefix like in CSS, and classes use . The list of classes and ids is found by querying the indexed values from TISTUD-2798. should query all files. For other tss files we can limit the scope to just the associated view (same hierarchy and basename).. Once we have a proper parser we can use it to highlight syntax errors. This will involve creating a build participant that simply grabs the context's AST, asks for the SyntaxErrors and hooks them as problems to the BuildContext. See. We need to generate a TSS Parser. See the PEGJS grammar here: We'll need to generate an LALR grammar from that and then use beaver to generate a parser. We may be able to simply copy the and modify slightly to handle the changes that alloy introduces.. Hook up a special Content Assist processor for Alloy view XML files. Provide Content Assist for attribute names in Alloy view XML files. We explicitly make use of ""Window"" as the assumed global namespace for all JS files. This is only correct if the file is intended to be run inside a browser. With the use of TiMobile JS and in that environment, ""Global"" is the type we should be querying - not Window. We may need to alter indexing CA to determine the proper Global type to use based on the file's location, or project nature. We can safely assume that any inline JS in an HTML file will use Window. Beyond that we may just want to assume Window for all except Titanium Mobile or projects.. There are no entries for things like etc in our metadata. We need to add metadata for the new items added in ECMAScript 5. See and. When we lookup globals for Content Assist we explicitly look for members of Window. This is wrong, because we also need to look up members of it's supertype Global.. Webserver core plugin starting too slowly. Restrict the icon to standard app store guidelines.. A comment with security level 'Developers' was removed.. Add a right-click ""Alloy Add Widget menu item command that opens a dialog wizard similar to our Project template ""alloy list widgets"" command. When user selects a widget put the id that is listed in the returned json metadata for the widget into the Alloy in the dependencies object. For example if the user selected the ""Search For Books"" widget then the config should look like the following. , , ,. Once we have the deprecated flag for more JSCA members, we need to validate and warn about deprecated usage on both build and reconcile. This would leave the typical yellow ""squiggly"" underlining of the reference, as well as an entry in the Problems view.. HTML Files get !DOCTYPE declarations marked as warnings for unclosed tags. Add Update All Modules Functionality. We currently assume that a project root is the module root path. We need to query node npm for the list of module load paths ($NODE PATH) and try to resolve search against those, as well as handle searching up the hierarchy for node modules directories, and handle loading ""core"" modules from node itself. The following pseudo-code gives the algorithm: See: Additionally, it may make sense to index the paths specified in NODE PATH on startup.. Add Alloy Widget menu item to select import widgets that are available locally. Add a right-click menu ""Alloy Add Widget (dynamic list of widgets)"". Place a separator between the dialog item (from TISTUD-2280) and the actual list. ""alloy list widgets"" command.

It should refresh the iOS info and show all the valid simulators.. After all the style elements are indexed, then the View file need to validate the missing style elements of 'class' and show any annotations if the class definitions are missing the corresponding style file or in the global file.. Create a Index reader to index all style elements defined in tss file. If a user defines style element such as 'class' for the a UI element in the View file, there is no way to let user define the style element block directly in the style file. Currently, they have to manually switch back to style file and then create the style data block using the 'class' element defined for the UI element. It would be easy for the user for a quick fix kind of mechanism, where they can press something similar to Cmd Ctrl + 1 on the class element value, and then create the style block in the tss file.. The View files in Alloy can contain ID types for each UI element. The types referenced in the View are probably defined in the corresponding Style file. Since Studio has knowledge of the Style code, it should allow to navigate the ID type to the Style code (similar to the F3 or method definition navigation in JDT Eclipse).. If a user defines style element such as 'id' for the a UI element in the View file, there is no way to let user define the style element block directly in the style file. Currently, they have to manually switch back to style file and then create the style data block using the Id defined for the UI element. It would be easy for the user for a quick fix kind of mechanism, where they can press something similar to Cmd Ctrl + 1 on the id value, and then create the style block in the tss file..

Add additional platform in the TiApp, for example to include Tizen. The platform shortcuts are not forever. If there is only one project in the explorer, then we need to unselect the project in the explorer to get the shortcuts related to Tizen. Otherwise, create a dummy project and change the selection between them to get the new platform launch shortcuts.. Android is still listed as the required SDK. The default user agents for Alloy and should refer to mobile platforms. The current default preferences for Alloy and project's user agent refers to the browsers such as Chrome, Firefox and IE.
